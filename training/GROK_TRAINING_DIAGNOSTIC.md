## Question


I'm training Qwen3-8B (8.2B params) with LoRA on CPU (48 cores, 110GB RAM) and concerned training may be stuck.

**Symptoms:**
- Step 1/24 completed in 35:49 minutes (logged at 17:52:08)
- Now 28 minutes later (18:20:35) - NO log update for step 2
- CPU usage: Steady 2670% (27 cores)
- Memory behavior: Fluctuating (123GB → 124GB → 120GB over 4 seconds)
- I/O: ZERO (no reads, no writes between steps)
- Process state: R (running), wchan: - (not waiting)

**Configuration:**
- Model: Qwen3-8B (8.2B params)
- LoRA rank: 16, alpha: 32
- Target modules: q/k/v/o_proj + gate/up/down_proj (7 modules)
- Batch size: 2, gradient accumulation: 16 (effective: 32)
- Framework: Transformers Trainer on CPU

**Questions:**

1. **Is 28+ minutes between step logs normal?**
   - Step 1 took 35:49
   - Should step 2 take similar time or be faster (compilation done)?
   - At what point should I consider it stuck?

2. **What does memory fluctuation indicate?**
   - 123GB → 124GB → 120GB in 4 seconds
   - Is this active computation or just garbage collection?
   - Would a stuck process show static memory?

3. **Why zero I/O between steps?**
   - No read_bytes, no write_bytes changing
   - Is data loading done in-memory after first step?
   - Should I see I/O for checkpoints/logging?

4. **How to definitively diagnose stuck vs working?**
   - What signals prove training is progressing?
   - What tools can I use to verify computation happening?
   - At what point should I kill and restart?

5. **PyTorch Trainer logging behavior:**
   - Does Trainer buffer logs until step complete?
   - Could step 2 be in progress but not visible in logs?
   - How long can computation run between log outputs?

**Context:**
This is critical Week 9 Phase 4 deliverable. Already invested 1 hour training time. Need to know if I should:
- A) Wait longer (if this is normal)
- B) Investigate deeper (if suspicious)
- C) Kill and restart with better logging (if stuck)

Please provide specific, actionable guidance based on PyTorch/Transformers behavior with large models on CPU.

## Grok Response

### Analysis of Training Symptoms and Configuration
I'll address your questions directly based on PyTorch/Transformers behavior with large language models (LLMs) like Qwen3-8B on CPU. Training 8B-parameter models with LoRA on CPU is inherently slow due to limited parallelism (even with 48 cores) and memory bottlenecks—expect step times in the tens of minutes for effective batch sizes like 32. Your setup (batch 2, grad accum 16) is reasonable for CPU, but this is not optimized hardware (GPUs would be 10-100x faster). No red flags for "stuck" yet, but let's break it down analytically.

1. **Is 28+ minutes between step logs normal?**
   - **Normality**: Yes, it's plausible and not necessarily stuck. Step 1 (35:49) likely included one-time overhead like model loading, data preprocessing, graph compilation (eager mode in PyTorch/Transformers still has some warmup), and initial LoRA adapter initialization. Subsequent steps (e.g., step 2) should be faster or similar, as compilation is done. However, CPU training of 8B models with LoRA (rank 16, 7 modules) involves heavy computation per step: forward pass (loading activations), backward pass (gradients for adapters + base model), and optimizer updates. With 48 cores and effective batch 32, a 35-40 min step is realistic—I've seen similar reports for CPU-based LLM fine-tuning (e.g., on Xeon setups).
   - **Should step 2 be faster?** Potentially yes (5-20% faster after warmup), but not guaranteed if there's variability in data batches or memory pressure. Your CPU usage (2670%, ~27/48 cores) and fluctuating memory suggest active work, not idling.
   - **When to consider it stuck?** Wait at least until the time exceeds Step 1's duration (e.g., 40-45 min total for Step 2). If no log update after 1.5-2x Step 1's time (~50-70 min), it's suspicious. Deadlocks or hangs in PyTorch/Transformers (rare but possible on CPU due to threading issues) might show static CPU/memory. Alternative perspective: If you had GPU, steps would be seconds, but CPU bottlenecks can cause "perceived hangs" during long computations.

2. **What does memory fluctuation indicate?**
   - **Indication**: Active computation. The rapid fluctuations (123GB → 124GB → 120GB in 4 seconds) are typical of PyTorch's dynamic memory allocation during training loops—allocating tensors for forward/backward passes, then deallocating/frees. This isn't just garbage collection (GC), which is usually slower and more periodic in PyTorch (e.g., every few minutes or epochs). Instead, it's the model's layers activating/deactivating in sequence (e.g., attention, MLPs), especially with LoRA targeting 7 modules (q/k/v/o_proj + gate/up/down_proj).
   - **Active vs. GC**: GC would show steadier drops (e.g., gradual from 124GB to 120GB over 10-30 seconds), not rapid seesawing. Here, it's computation-driven.
   - **Stuck process behavior**: A truly stuck process (e.g., infinite loop or deadlock) would show static memory (no changes) and low/zero CPU. Your process is R (running) with high CPU and fluctuating memory, so it's likely progressing. Alternative: Memory could be overcommitted (exceeding 110GB physical RAM via swap/virtual memory), causing thrashing—but your zero I/O suggests no heavy swapping yet.

3. **Why zero I/O between steps?**
   - **Reason**: Likely normal. If your dataset is small and fits in memory (common for fine-tuning), data loading happens once at startup or epoch begin, not per step. PyTorch/Transformers' DataLoader pre-loads batches in-memory. LoRA training doesn't require frequent disk access for the base model (it's static in memory).
   - **In-memory loading**: Yes—after Step 1, subsequent steps pull from RAM buffers. No I/O for data unless you're reloading from disk (e.g., large datasets with shuffling).
   - **Checkpoints/logging**: I/O should be minimal between steps. Checkpoints (model saves) typically happen at save_steps or epoch end, not per step. Logging (your step completions) is to stdout/files, which might not show as "I/O bytes" in tools like `iotop` (it focuses on disk I/O, not in-memory logs). If logging to a file, you might see small writes, but zero overall suggests efficient buffering. Alternative perspective: If you have `save_steps=1`, expect some I/O at step end, but your zero aligns with in-memory training.

4. **How to definitively diagnose stuck vs working?**
   - **Signals of progress**: High CPU (>2000%), fluctuating memory, process state R (running), and eventual log output. In PyTorch, check for tensor operations via `strace` (look for syscalls like mmap/read on model files) or `gdb` (attach and see if it's in a loop). No crashes or errors in logs is a good sign.
   - **Tools to verify**: 
     - `htop` or `top`: Monitor CPU cores, memory, and threads—ensure threads are active (not sleeping).
     - `strace -p <PID>`: Trace syscalls; active training shows frequent calls (e.g., to BLAS libraries for matmuls). Stuck: few or repeating calls.
     - `gdb -p <PID>`: Attach and `bt` (backtrace)—if stuck in a loop (e.g., infinite wait), you'll see it. For PyTorch, it might show C++ threads in computation.
     - PyTorch profiler: Add `torch.profiler.profile()` in code to log operations (e.g., time spent in forward/backward).
     - Memory profiler: Use `tracemalloc` or PyTorch's memory tracker to confirm allocations match training phases.
   - **When to kill and restart**: After 1.5-2x Step 1's time (~50-70 min) with no log, kill it (`kill -9 <PID>`). If restarted, add verbose logging (e.g., `logging_steps=1`, `save_steps=1`) and monitor with tools above. Alternative: If memory hits system limits (e.g., OOM), it might hang—restart with smaller batch/accum to free RAM.

5. **PyTorch Trainer logging behavior:**
   - **Buffering**: Yes, logs are often buffered and flushed at step end. Transformers' Trainer uses Python's logging, which can delay output until a flush (e.g., after `print` or file write). So, Step 2 could be 99% done but not logged yet.
   - **Step in progress but not visible**: Absolutely—computation runs asynchronously, and logs appear post-step completion. Your 28 min wait is within normal bounds; don't assume stuck just because logs are pending.
   - **How long between outputs**: Varies widely (seconds to hours for large models). For your setup, 30-60 min gaps are expected if `logging_steps=1`. Trainer doesn't interrupt mid-step for logs; it's sequential.

### Recommendation (A, B, or C)
- **A) Wait longer (if this is normal)**: Yes, wait 10-20 more minutes (total ~50 min for Step 2). Your symptoms (high CPU, memory fluctuation, running state) strongly indicate progress, not a hang. 35 min steps are slow but plausible for 8B params on CPU—don't panic prematurely. Monitor with `htop` for any CPU drop or memory stabilization (signs of stuck).
- **B) Investigate deeper (if suspicious)**: If you want to confirm, run `strace -p <PID> -c` for 1-2 min to count syscalls (high activity = working). Or add a simple progress hook in code (e.g., print timestamps mid-step).
- **C) Kill and restart (if stuck)**: Not yet—only if no log after ~60 min. Restart with `torch.set_num_threads(48)` for full CPU use, reduce grad accum to 8 if memory is tight, and enable PyTorch profiling for diagnostics.

This isn't stuck; it's just slow CPU training. If it completes Step 2 soon, you're good. For future, consider GPU or optimized CPU libs (e.g., Intel MKL). Let me know if symptoms change!
