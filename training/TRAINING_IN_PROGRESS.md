## Monitoring Commands

### Check Process Status
```bash
# View process info
ps -p $(cat training/training.pid) -o pid,stat,%cpu,%mem,etime,cmd

# Check if still running
ps -p $(cat training/training.pid) > /dev/null && echo "✓ Running" || echo "✗ Stopped"
```

### View Training Logs
```bash
# Follow live output
tail -f training/logs/training_*.log

# View last 50 lines
tail -50 training/logs/training_*.log

# Search for progress
grep -E "step|loss|epoch" training/logs/training_*.log | tail -20
```

### Check System Resources
```bash
# CPU usage
htop

# Memory usage
free -h

# Disk space (for checkpoints)
du -sh training/models/qwen2.5-coder-7b-lora/
```

### Check Training Progress
```bash
# List checkpoints
ls -lh training/models/qwen2.5-coder-7b-lora/checkpoint-*/

# Count completed steps (checkpoints saved every 50 steps)
ls training/models/qwen2.5-coder-7b-lora/checkpoint-* 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

## Expected Timeline

| Time Elapsed | Expected Progress | Checkpoint |
|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| 0-30 min | Step 0-2 | Initial steps slow |
| 1 hour | Step 3-5 | - |
| 3 hours | Step 10-12 | - |
| 6 hours | Step 20-25 | - |
| 12 hours | Step 35-40 | Epoch 2-3 |
| 18 hours | Step 43-45 | Near completion |
| 24 hours | Complete | final_model saved |

**Note**: First few steps may be slower as the system warms up. Steps should stabilize to 10-20 minutes each after the first 3-5 steps.

---

## What to Expect

### During Training

1. **CPU usage will remain high** (~3000-3500%, using 30-35 cores)
2. **Memory usage will stabilize** around 6-8GB
3. **Log file will update** after each step completes (~every 10-20 min)
4. **Checkpoints will be saved** every 50 steps (only 1 expected at step 45)

### Signs of Healthy Training

✅ CPU usage consistently high (>2000%)
✅ Memory usage stable (not increasing infinitely)
✅ Process state: R or Rl (Running)
✅ Log file size growing over time
✅ Training loss decreasing (visible in logs after steps complete)

### Signs of Problems

❌ CPU usage drops to 0%
❌ Memory usage exceeds 80GB (OOM risk)
❌ Process state: Z (Zombie) or D (Uninterruptible sleep)
❌ No log updates for >1 hour after first step
❌ Training loss increasing or NaN

## Troubleshooting

### Training Seems Stuck

**First step can take 10-20 minutes**. Wait at least 30 minutes before considering it stuck.

Check if actively computing:
```bash
# CPU should be high
ps -p $(cat training/training.pid) -o %cpu
```

### Out of Memory

**Unlikely with 110GB RAM**, but if it happens:
```bash
# Kill training
kill $(cat training/training.pid)

# Edit script to reduce batch size
# training/scripts/train_lora.py: change per_device_train_batch_size to 1

# Restart
nohup venv/bin/python3 training/scripts/train_lora.py \
  > training/logs/training_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log 2>&1 &
echo $! > training/training.pid
```

### Need to Stop Training

```bash
# Graceful stop
kill $(cat training/training.pid)

# Force stop (if needed)
kill -9 $(cat training/training.pid)

# Resume from checkpoint (if available)
venv/bin/python3 training/scripts/train_lora.py \
  --resume training/models/qwen2.5-coder-7b-lora/checkpoint-50
```

---

## After Training Completes

### Verify Completion

```bash
# Check for final model
ls -lh training/models/qwen2.5-coder-7b-lora/final_model/

# Should see:
# - adapter_config.json
# - adapter_model.safetensors
# - tokenizer files
```

### Next Steps

1. **Evaluate on test set** (31 examples)
   ```bash
   venv/bin/python3 training/scripts/evaluate_lora.py \
     --model training/models/qwen2.5-coder-7b-lora/final_model \
     --test-data training/data/test.jsonl
   ```

2. **Compare with baseline**
   - Baseline: 98.7% success, 20.1s avg latency
   - Fine-tuned: ? success, ? latency

3. **Decision**:
   - **Deploy** if: Speed <12s AND Quality ≥98%
   - **Iterate** if: One metric fails
   - **Abort** if: Both metrics fail
