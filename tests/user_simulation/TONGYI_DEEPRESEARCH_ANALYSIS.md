## Suitability Criteria Assessment

### 1. Hardware Requirements ⚠️ **PARTIALLY MET**

**CPU Inference Performance Estimate:**
```
With MoE (3B active params):
- Q4_K_M: ~25-30 tokens/second (8-core CPU)
- Q5_K_M: ~20-25 tokens/second (8-core CPU)
- Q6_K: ~18-22 tokens/second (8-core CPU)

Comparison to dense models:
- Dense 30B Q4: ~3-5 tok/s ❌ Too slow
- Dense 14B Q5: ~8-10 tok/s
- MoE 30B Q5: ~20-25 tok/s ✅ Faster!
```

**Why MoE is Faster:**
- Only activates 3B params instead of 30B
- 10x speedup vs dense 30B
- 2-3x faster than dense 14B
- With quality of full 30B model

**RAM Requirements:**
- Minimum: 20GB (Q4_K_M)
- Recommended: 24-32GB (Q5_K_M)
- Optimal: 32GB+ (Q6_K)

**Verdict:** ✅ **MET** if hardware ≥24GB RAM

- Routing layer adds minimal overhead

**Verdict:** ✅ **FULLY OPTIMIZED**

---

### 5. Agentic Orientation ⭐⭐⭐ **EXCEPTIONALLY MET**

**This is the killer feature.**

**Training Approach:**
```
Specialized Training Pipeline:
1. Automated synthetic data generation for agentic tasks
2. Large-scale continual pre-training on agentic interaction data
3. End-to-end reinforcement learning with custom optimization
4. Trained on ReAct paradigm (Reasoning + Acting)
```

**ReAct Paradigm:**
```python
# What ReAct looks like in practice:
Thought: I need to break down this task into subtasks
Action: Create plan with 3 steps
Observation: Plan created successfully
Thought: Now I need to assign each subtask to appropriate agents
Action: Evaluate agent capabilities and assign tasks
Observation: Assignments complete
Thought: Ready to execute
Action: Coordinate parallel execution
```

**Two Inference Modes:**
1. **ReAct mode** - Standard reasoning + acting
2. **IterResearch "Heavy" mode** - Iterative deep research (our use case!)

**Designed For:**
- "Long-horizon, deep information-seeking tasks" ← Exactly our coordinator role
- Agentic search and complex information retrieval
- Multi-step planning and execution
- Task decomposition and delegation

**Benchmarks (from Alibaba):**
- Humanity's Last Exam: Strong performance
- BrowserComp: Agent-based web interaction
- WebWalkerQA: Multi-step web research
- GAIA: General AI Assistant benchmark

**Comparison to General-Purpose Models:**
| Model | Agentic Training | Coordinator Fit |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|
| GPT-4 | General | ★★★★ |
| Qwen2.5-14B | General | ★★★★ |
| Mistral-7B | General | ★★★ |
| **Tongyi-DeepResearch** | **Specialized** | **★★★★★** |

**Verdict:** ⭐⭐⭐ **PURPOSE-BUILT FOR OUR USE CASE**

---

### 6. Advanced Reasoning & Thinking Skills ✅ **FULLY MET**

**Training Focus:**
- Continual pre-training to "strengthen reasoning performance"
- Reinforcement learning for multi-step reasoning
- Long-horizon planning capabilities

**Model Size Advantage:**
- 30B params (even with 3B active) provides strong reasoning
- Qwen3 architecture known for strong reasoning benchmarks
- MoE allows specialization (some experts for reasoning, others for tool use)

**Expected Performance:**
```
Based on Qwen3 architecture and 30B param size:
- MMLU (reasoning): ~80+ (estimated)
- GSM8K (math): ~85+ (estimated)
- MT-Bench (multi-turn): ~8.5/10 (estimated)
```

**Verdict:** ✅ **STRONG REASONING CAPABILITIES**

        return response

    def _format_react_prompt(self, messages) -> str:
        """Format prompt to trigger ReAct reasoning."""
        # Tongyi-DeepResearch expects specific format
        # for optimal agentic behavior
        prompt = "<|im_start|>system\n"
        prompt += "You are a coordinator agent using the ReAct paradigm.\n"
        prompt += "Think step-by-step: Thought → Action → Observation\n"
        prompt += "<|im_end|>\n"

        for msg in messages:
            prompt += f"<|im_start|>{msg['role']}\n{msg['content']}<|im_end|>\n"

        prompt += "<|im_start|>assistant\nThought: "
        return prompt
```

### Phase 3: Testing with User Simulation (Days 4-5)

```python
# tests/user_simulation/test_tongyi_coordinator.py
async def test_tongyi_coordinator_planning():
    """Test Tongyi-DeepResearch as coordinator agent."""

        description="Create a Python web scraper that extracts article titles from a news site, includes unit tests, and generates documentation",
        task_id="complex_coordinator_test",
        priority=1
    )

    coordinator = create_coordinator(provider_type="tongyi")
    result = await coordinator.coordinate_task(task)

    # Expect agentic behavior
    assert result.status == ExecutionStatus.SUCCESS
    assert "subtask" in result.output.lower() or "step" in result.output.lower()
    assert "coder" in result.output.lower() or "tester" in result.output.lower()

    # Tongyi should show ReAct reasoning
    assert "thought:" in result.output.lower() or "thinking:" in result.output.lower()
```

### Phase 4: Production Deployment (Day 6)

```python
# config/models.yaml (new file)
models:
  coordinator:
    provider: tongyi
    model_path: ./models/tongyi/Tongyi-DeepResearch-30B-A3B-Q5_K_M.gguf
    context_size: 8192
    threads: 8
