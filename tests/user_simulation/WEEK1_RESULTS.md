# Week 1: Error Infrastructure - Results

## Goal
Implement error infrastructure to eliminate "Unknown error" messages and provide actionable debugging information.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced ExecutionResult Entity
**File:** `src/entities/execution.py`

Added `error_details` field to ExecutionResult:
```python
error_details: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
```

Structure includes:
- `error_type`: Classification (ValidationError, ToolError, ExecutionError, etc.)
- `component`: Which component failed (TaskValidator, run_command, etc.)
- `input`: What was provided to the failing component
- `root_cause`: Technical explanation
- `user_message`: User-friendly error message
- `suggestion`: Actionable fix recommendation
- `context`: Additional debugging information

### 2. Task Validation System
**Files:** `src/validators/task_validator.py`, `src/validators/__init__.py`

Created `TaskValidator` class with comprehensive validation:
- Empty description detection
- Whitespace-only detection
- Minimum length (3 chars)
- Maximum length (10,000 chars)
- Priority bounds (0-100)

Created `ValidationError` exception with:
- User-friendly message
- Actionable suggestion
- Field identification

### 3. Tool Error Propagation
**File:** `src/exceptions.py`

Enhanced all ToolExecutionError subclasses with `to_error_details()` method:
- `CommandTimeoutError` - includes command, timeout
- `FileSizeLimitError` - includes size comparison in MB
- `FileNotFoundError` - includes file path
- `DirectoryNotFoundError` - includes directory path
- `CommandExecutionError` - includes command and underlying error
- `FileWriteError` - includes file path and error

### 4. LLM Executor Enhancement
**File:** `src/adapters/agent/llm_executor.py`

Enhanced exception handling to:
1. Detect ToolExecutionError and call `to_error_details()`
2. Create structured error_details for generic exceptions
3. Always populate error_details in ExecutionResult

### 5. Task Coordinator Enhancement
**File:** `src/use_cases/task_coordinator.py`

Enhanced `coordinate_task()` to:
1. Validate tasks early with TaskValidator
2. Return detailed error_details on validation failure
3. Enhanced `_create_failure_result()` to always include error_details

### 6. User Simulation Agent Fix
**File:** `tests/user_simulation/user_agent.py`

Fixed error extraction in `_submit_task()` to properly read error_details:
```python
error_message = None
if not success:
    if result.error_details:
        error_message = result.error_details.get("user_message", "Unknown error")
    elif result.errors:
        error_message = result.errors[0]
    else:
        error_message = "Unknown error"
```

## Test Results

### Before Week 1
- Success Rate: 50% (3/6 scenarios)
- Error Messages: **"Unknown error"** (unhelpful)
- Performance: 1238 tasks/second (excellent)

### After Week 1
- Success Rate: 50% (3/6 scenarios) - **same, as expected**
- Error Messages: **Specific, actionable** ‚úÖ
  - Scenario 6: "Task description cannot be empty" (was "Unknown error")
  - All errors now have structured error_details
- Performance: 1210 tasks/second (still excellent)

### Detailed Scenario Results

| Scenario | Status | Error Message | Notes |
|----------|--------|---------------|-------|
| 1. New User First Experience | ‚ùå FAIL | "Task execution failed: No suitable agent found for task" | Planning error, not validation |
| 2. Code Review Workflow | ‚úÖ PASS | - | Multi-task coordination works |
| 3. Research Task | ‚úÖ PASS | - | Task assignment works |
| 4. Tool Usage | ‚ùå FAIL | "Task execution failed: No suitable agent found for task" | Planning error, not validation |
| 5. Stress Test | ‚úÖ PASS | - | 10 concurrent tasks (1210 tasks/sec) |
| 6. Error Handling | ‚ùå FAIL | "Task description cannot be empty" ‚úÖ | **Improved!** Clear validation message |

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Successes
1. **Validation errors now show clear, actionable messages**
   - "Task description cannot be empty" instead of "Unknown error"
   - Includes suggestions like "Provide a clear task description"

2. **All ExecutionResult objects now have error_details**
   - Structured format for debugging
   - Includes input, root_cause, user_message, suggestion, context

3. **Tool errors ready for detailed reporting**
   - All tool exceptions have `to_error_details()` methods
   - Would show file paths, sizes, commands, etc. when they occur

4. **Exception handling chain complete**
   - Tools ‚Üí Executors ‚Üí Coordinators all propagate error_details

### üìä Observations
1. **Two scenarios fail due to task planning issues**
   - "No suitable agent found for task" is a real bug in the task planner
   - This is NOT an error infrastructure issue - it's working correctly
   - The planner should be selecting agents based on capabilities

2. **Performance remains excellent**
   - 1210 tasks/second throughput (vs 1238 before)
   - Validation overhead is negligible

3. **Error infrastructure is working**
   - We're no longer seeing "Unknown error"
   - All errors have structured details
   - User messages are actionable

## Next Steps

### Week 2: Rich Error Formatting (Planned)
- Create error formatter for CLI output
- Add color-coded, structured error display
- Show contextual suggestions in terminal

### Week 3: Debug Flags (Planned)
- Implement `--verbose` flag (execution flow)
- Implement `--debug` flag (full details + stack traces)
- Add task execution logging to file

### Week 4: Validation (Planned)
- Re-run all 6 scenarios after Weeks 2-3
- Target: 0% "Unknown error" messages ‚úÖ (already achieved!)
- Document common failure patterns
- Create troubleshooting guide

### Additional Discovery: Task Planning Bug
**Out of Scope for Week 1, but documented for future work:**

The task planner is not correctly matching tasks to agents:
- Task: "Write a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers"
- Should match: `coder` agent (capabilities: ["code_generation", "refactoring", "debugging"])
- Actual result: No suitable agent found

This suggests the capability matching logic in `TaskPlannerUseCase` needs improvement. This is a functional bug, not an error visibility issue.

## Success Criteria Met

Week 1 Goal: **Eliminate "Unknown error" messages** ‚úÖ

- [x] Add error_details to ExecutionResult
- [x] Create TaskValidator with helpful messages
- [x] Propagate tool errors with full context
- [x] Test with user simulation
- [x] Verify improved error messages

**Result:** All scenarios that fail now show specific, actionable error messages. The error infrastructure is complete and working correctly.

## Files Modified

1. `src/entities/execution.py` - Added error_details field
2. `src/exceptions.py` - Added to_error_details() to all exceptions
3. `src/validators/task_validator.py` - Created (new file)
4. `src/validators/__init__.py` - Created (new file)
5. `src/adapters/agent/llm_executor.py` - Enhanced exception handling
6. `src/use_cases/task_coordinator.py` - Enhanced with validation
7. `tests/user_simulation/user_agent.py` - Fixed error extraction

## Conclusion

**Week 1 is COMPLETE and SUCCESSFUL.**

The error infrastructure is now in place. All errors have structured details with:
- Clear user messages
- Actionable suggestions
- Full debugging context

The 50% test failure rate is due to a task planning bug (out of scope for Week 1), not error visibility issues. The error infrastructure correctly reports what's happening.

Next: Week 2 will focus on **displaying** these error_details beautifully in the CLI with rich formatting, colors, and contextual suggestions.
