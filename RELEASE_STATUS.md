## ‚è≥ What's Happening Now

The **GitHub Actions workflow** is currently running. This is a **fully automated process** that takes 7-10 minutes and includes:

### Phase 1: Build & Test (~3-4 min)
- Running tests on Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- Verifying coverage ‚â• 85%
- Running security scans

### Phase 2: Publish to PyPI (~1-2 min)
- Building Python package (wheel + sdist)
- Validating package with twine
- **Publishing to PyPI** ‚Üê This is why `pip install` doesn't work yet

### Phase 3: Build Docker Image (~2-3 min)
- Building multi-architecture image (amd64, arm64)
- Tagging with version and latest
- Pushing to Docker Hub

### Phase 4: Create GitHub Release (~30 sec)
- Generating changelog
- Creating GitHub Release page
- Uploading artifacts

| Time | Phase | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| T+0m | Tag pushed to GitHub | ‚úì Complete |
| T+1m | Workflow queued | ‚è≥ Running |
| T+2-5m | Build & Test | ‚è≥ Running |
| T+6-7m | Publish to PyPI | ‚è≥ Pending |
| T+8-10m | Build Docker image | ‚è≥ Pending |
| T+10m | Create GitHub Release | ‚è≥ Pending |
| T+10m | **DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE** | ‚è≥ Pending |

**Current time estimate:** Wait ~10 minutes from tag push

## ‚ùì Why `pip install` Failed

The error you saw:
```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement unified-intelligence-cli==1.0.0
ERROR: No matching distribution found for unified-intelligence-cli==1.0.0
```

**This is EXPECTED!** The package isn't on PyPI yet because:
1. ‚úì Tag was pushed (done)
2. ‚è≥ Workflow is building the package
3. ‚è≥ Workflow will publish to PyPI (~5-7 minutes)
4. Then `pip install` will work

---

## ‚úÖ Verify Deployment (After ~10 minutes)

### 1. Check PyPI

**Wait for workflow to complete**, then:
```bash
pip install unified-intelligence-cli==1.0.0
```

**Or check PyPI directly:**  
https://pypi.org/project/unified-intelligence-cli/1.0.0/

### 2. Check Docker Hub

```bash
docker pull YOUR_USERNAME/unified-intelligence-cli:1.0.0
```

**Or check Docker Hub:**  
https://hub.docker.com/r/YOUR_USERNAME/unified-intelligence-cli/tags

### 3. Check GitHub Release

https://github.com/hollis-source/unified-intelligence-cli/releases/tag/v1.0.0

---

## üéØ What to Do Now

### Option 1: Wait and Verify (Recommended)

```bash
# Wait ~10 minutes, then verify:
pip install unified-intelligence-cli==1.0.0
ui-cli --version
```

### Option 2: Monitor Workflow

Open in browser:
https://github.com/hollis-source/unified-intelligence-cli/actions

Watch the workflow progress in real-time.

### Option 3: Be Notified

Set a timer for 10 minutes, then check:
```bash
pip search unified-intelligence-cli
# Or just try:
pip install unified-intelligence-cli
```

---

## üö® If Workflow Fails

If after 15 minutes the package still isn't available:

1. **Check workflow status:**
   ```bash
   # In browser:
   https://github.com/hollis-source/unified-intelligence-cli/actions
   ```

2. **Check for errors in workflow logs**

3. **Common issues:**
   - PYPI_API_TOKEN expired or invalid
   - Docker Hub credentials incorrect
   - Build failures (tests, coverage)

4. **Fix and retry:**
   ```bash
   # Delete failed tag
   git push --delete origin v1.0.0
   git tag -d v1.0.0
   
   # Fix issue, then retry
   ./scripts/release-now.sh
   ```

---

## üìä Expected Workflow Output

When the workflow completes successfully, you'll see:

1. **‚úì Build and Test** - All tests passed
2. **‚úì Publish to PyPI** - Package uploaded
3. **‚úì Publish to Docker** - Image built and pushed
4. **‚úì Create GitHub Release** - Release page created

Then:
```bash
$ pip install unified-intelligence-cli==1.0.0
Collecting unified-intelligence-cli==1.0.0
  Downloading unified_intelligence_cli-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
Installing collected packages: unified-intelligence-cli
Successfully installed unified-intelligence-cli-1.0.0

$ ui-cli --version
ui-cli version 1.0.0
```

## üéâ Next Steps After Deployment

Once the workflow completes and verification passes:

1. **‚úì Version 1.0.0 released!**
2. **Test installation** on clean machine
3. **Update documentation** (if needed)
4. **Announce release:**
   - GitHub Discussions
   - Social media
   - Relevant communities
5. **Begin Week 3-4: Alpha Rollout**
   - Recruit 10 alpha users
   - Collect feedback
   - Monitor usage
   - Iterate based on data
