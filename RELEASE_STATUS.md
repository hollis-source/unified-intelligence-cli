# Release v1.0.0 Status - IN PROGRESS ⏳

**Date:** 2025-09-30  
**Status:** GitHub Actions workflow running  
**Expected completion:** ~10 minutes from tag push

---

## ✅ What's Complete

1. **✓ Tag created and pushed** - v1.0.0 pushed to GitHub
2. **✓ GitHub Actions triggered** - Workflow started automatically
3. **✓ All pre-flight checks passed** - 7/7 checks green
4. **✓ Secrets configured** - PyPI and Docker Hub credentials set

---

## ⏳ What's Happening Now

The **GitHub Actions workflow** is currently running. This is a **fully automated process** that takes 7-10 minutes and includes:

### Phase 1: Build & Test (~3-4 min)
- Running tests on Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- Verifying coverage ≥ 85%
- Running security scans

### Phase 2: Publish to PyPI (~1-2 min)
- Building Python package (wheel + sdist)
- Validating package with twine
- **Publishing to PyPI** ← This is why `pip install` doesn't work yet

### Phase 3: Build Docker Image (~2-3 min)
- Building multi-architecture image (amd64, arm64)
- Tagging with version and latest
- Pushing to Docker Hub

### Phase 4: Create GitHub Release (~30 sec)
- Generating changelog
- Creating GitHub Release page
- Uploading artifacts

## 🔍 Monitor Progress

**Primary:** Check GitHub Actions workflow  
https://github.com/hollis-source/autonomous-task-agent-dev-orchestration/actions

**Specific workflow:**  
https://github.com/hollis-source/autonomous-task-agent-dev-orchestration/actions/workflows/release.yml

**Expected Release page (after completion):**  
https://github.com/hollis-source/autonomous-task-agent-dev-orchestration/releases/tag/v1.0.0

## ⏰ Timeline

| Time | Phase | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| T+0m | Tag pushed to GitHub | ✓ Complete |
| T+1m | Workflow queued | ⏳ Running |
| T+2-5m | Build & Test | ⏳ Running |
| T+6-7m | Publish to PyPI | ⏳ Pending |
| T+8-10m | Build Docker image | ⏳ Pending |
| T+10m | Create GitHub Release | ⏳ Pending |
| T+10m | **DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE** | ⏳ Pending |

**Current time estimate:** Wait ~10 minutes from tag push

## ❓ Why `pip install` Failed

The error you saw:
```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement autonomous-task-agent-dev-orchestration==1.0.0
ERROR: No matching distribution found for autonomous-task-agent-dev-orchestration==1.0.0
```

**This is EXPECTED!** The package isn't on PyPI yet because:
1. ✓ Tag was pushed (done)
2. ⏳ Workflow is building the package
3. ⏳ Workflow will publish to PyPI (~5-7 minutes)
4. Then `pip install` will work

---

## ✅ Verify Deployment (After ~10 minutes)

### 1. Check PyPI

**Wait for workflow to complete**, then:
```bash
pip install autonomous-task-agent-dev-orchestration==1.0.0
```

**Or check PyPI directly:**  
https://pypi.org/project/autonomous-task-agent-dev-orchestration/1.0.0/

### 2. Check Docker Hub

```bash
docker pull YOUR_USERNAME/autonomous-task-agent-dev-orchestration:1.0.0
```

**Or check Docker Hub:**  
https://hub.docker.com/r/YOUR_USERNAME/autonomous-task-agent-dev-orchestration/tags

### 3. Check GitHub Release

https://github.com/hollis-source/autonomous-task-agent-dev-orchestration/releases/tag/v1.0.0

---

## 🎯 What to Do Now

### Option 1: Wait and Verify (Recommended)

```bash
# Wait ~10 minutes, then verify:
pip install autonomous-task-agent-dev-orchestration==1.0.0
atado --version
```

### Option 2: Monitor Workflow

Open in browser:
https://github.com/hollis-source/autonomous-task-agent-dev-orchestration/actions

Watch the workflow progress in real-time.

### Option 3: Be Notified

Set a timer for 10 minutes, then check:
```bash
pip search autonomous-task-agent-dev-orchestration
# Or just try:
pip install autonomous-task-agent-dev-orchestration
```

---

## 🚨 If Workflow Fails

If after 15 minutes the package still isn't available:

1. **Check workflow status:**
   ```bash
   # In browser:
   https://github.com/hollis-source/autonomous-task-agent-dev-orchestration/actions
   ```

2. **Check for errors in workflow logs**

3. **Common issues:**
   - PYPI_API_TOKEN expired or invalid
   - Docker Hub credentials incorrect
   - Build failures (tests, coverage)

4. **Fix and retry:**
   ```bash
   # Delete failed tag
   git push --delete origin v1.0.0
   git tag -d v1.0.0
   
   # Fix issue, then retry
   ./scripts/release-now.sh
   ```

---

## 📊 Expected Workflow Output

When the workflow completes successfully, you'll see:

1. **✓ Build and Test** - All tests passed
2. **✓ Publish to PyPI** - Package uploaded
3. **✓ Publish to Docker** - Image built and pushed
4. **✓ Create GitHub Release** - Release page created

Then:
```bash
$ pip install autonomous-task-agent-dev-orchestration==1.0.0
Collecting autonomous-task-agent-dev-orchestration==1.0.0
  Downloading autonomous_task_agent_dev_orchestration-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
Installing collected packages: autonomous-task-agent-dev-orchestration
Successfully installed autonomous-task-agent-dev-orchestration-1.0.0

$ atado --version
atado version 1.0.0
```

## 🎉 Next Steps After Deployment

Once the workflow completes and verification passes:

1. **✓ Version 1.0.0 released!**
2. **Test installation** on clean machine
3. **Update documentation** (if needed)
4. **Announce release:**
   - GitHub Discussions
   - Social media
   - Relevant communities
5. **Begin Week 3-4: Alpha Rollout**
   - Recruit 10 alpha users
   - Collect feedback
   - Monitor usage
   - Iterate based on data
