# Architecture Review Request

I need you to critically review our Clean Architecture implementation against Robert C. Martin's principles.

## The Critique We Received

Someone claimed our implementation has these violations:

1. **SRP Violation**: `CoordinateAgentsUseCase` mixes orchestration with execution; should split into `TaskDistributorUseCase` (planning) and `AgentRunnerUseCase` (execution).

2. **DIP Issue**: Concrete adapters referenced in main.py - should inject via abstractions only.

3. **ISP Weakness**: Interfaces too broad - need further segregation.

4. **Clean Code Gap**: Functions exceed 20 lines - should refactor.

## My Counter-Analysis

1. **SRP**: The coordinator DOES have one responsibility: "coordinate multi-agent execution with planning." It delegates actual execution to injected `IAgentExecutor`. Planning and coordination are cohesive. Splitting would create artificial separation.

2. **DIP**: We use factories (AgentFactory, ProviderFactory) that return interfaces. No concrete adapters in main.py. The critique appears false.

3. **ISP**: Each interface (IAgentExecutor, IAgentSelector, IAgentCoordinator) has a single focused method. Already properly segregated.

4. **Clean Code**: Some methods exceed 20 lines, but they're cohesive algorithms (e.g., topological sort for parallel groups in `_compute_parallel_groups`).

## Current Implementation Facts

- `CoordinateAgentsUseCase` has these private methods:
  - `_planning_phase`: Uses LLM to create execution plan (35 lines)
  - `_parse_plan`: Converts LLM response to ExecutionPlan (26 lines)
  - `_compute_parallel_groups`: Topological sort for dependencies (28 lines)
  - `_execute_plan`: Runs tasks in parallel groups (42 lines)
  - `_execute_task_with_retry`: Retries with exponential backoff (24 lines)

- `main.py`: Uses factories and compose_dependencies - no concretes imported

- Interfaces: All have single methods per ISP

## Questions for Critical Review

**Be critical and data-based. Challenge my assumptions if wrong.**

1. Is the SRP critique valid? Does CoordinateAgentsUseCase violate single responsibility by combining planning + coordination? Should we split it?

2. Does our DIP implementation properly use abstractions, or is there a concrete dependency leak I'm missing?

3. Are our interfaces properly segregated per ISP, or should they be split further?

4. Is the 20-line rule dogmatic, or should we strictly enforce it even for cohesive algorithms?

5. What real improvements (backed by data/evidence) would you recommend?

**Provide specific recommendations with rationale based on Martin's actual writings and industry data (e.g., CrewAI patterns, production practices).**
