**PROJECT CONTEXT:**
- Just completed: v1.0.0 release to PyPI + Docker Hub
- Status: PRODUCTION READY (85% coverage, 126 tests, Clean Architecture)
- Distribution pipeline: GitHub Actions automation complete
- Current implementation: Python CLI for multi-agent AI orchestration
- Tech stack: Click CLI, mock provider, tool support (file ops, shell commands)
- Architecture: Clean Architecture + SOLID principles
- Documentation: INSTALL.md, QUICKSTART.md, SECURITY.md complete

**YOUR TASK:**
Analyze the project state and determine the optimal NEXT PIPELINE to implement.

**ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:**
1. **Current State Assessment:**
   - Technical architecture strengths/gaps
   - Production readiness evaluation
   - Market positioning

2. **Strategic Gap Analysis:**
   - Critical blockers for adoption
   - Technical debt priorities
   - Risk assessment

3. **Pipeline Options:**
   Evaluate these candidates:
   - Production Hardening & Observability (logging, metrics, tracing, load testing)
   - Multi-Provider Support (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
   - Feature Enhancement (Web UI, advanced tools, scheduling)
   - Performance Optimization (scale testing, concurrency improvements)
   - Community Building (marketing, user acquisition, ecosystem)

4. **Recommendation:**
   - Top recommendation with full justification
   - Evidence-based scoring (impact, effort, risk, urgency)
   - Implementation roadmap (4-week plan)
   - Success criteria and metrics

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- Be data-driven and cite evidence from the project
- Use objective scoring (quantitative where possible)
- Address counter-arguments
- Provide actionable next steps
- Think like a strategic consultant, not a feature enthusiast

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Structured analysis with:
- Executive Summary
- Detailed Assessment
- Final Recommendation with Roadmap
- Risk Mitigation Plan
