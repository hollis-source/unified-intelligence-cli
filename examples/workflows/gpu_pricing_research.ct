# GPU Inference Provider Research Pipeline
# Real-world DSL usage: Research best value GPU providers (October 2025)
#
# Excluded: vast.ai (per user request)
# Target: Find best $/performance for 8B model inference
#
# Research Strategy:
# 1. Parallel data collection from 8 providers
# 2. Normalize pricing data to comparable format
# 3. Calculate value metrics ($/hour, $/TFLOPS, cost for 1M tokens)
# 4. Filter by use case (inference-optimized)
# 5. Generate ranked recommendation
#
# Category Theory: Parallel fetch → Sequential analysis
# Estimated time: 2-3 minutes (parallel fetching saves ~80%)
#
# Providers to research:
# - RunPod: Pay-per-second GPU rentals (popular for inference)
# - Lambda Labs: Reserved instances (bulk discounts)
# - Paperspace: Gradient platform (managed inference)
# - Together.ai: Serverless inference API
# - Replicate: Pay-per-use model hosting
# - Modal: Serverless GPU functions
# - CoreWeave: Kubernetes GPU cloud (enterprise)
# - Jarvis Labs: Educational/research pricing
