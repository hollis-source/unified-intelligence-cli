# Parallel Multi-Model Code Review Workflow
# Demonstrates broadcast composition for simultaneous AI model analysis
#
# Category Theory Foundation:
#   duplicate :: a -> (a × a)                           (Diagonal functor)
#   (f × g) :: (A × C) -> (B × D)                      (Product morphism)
#   (f × g) ∘ duplicate :: A -> (B × D)                (Broadcast composition)
#
# Use Case: Parallel code review with multiple AI models analyzing different aspects
# Performance: 2x speedup (parallel vs sequential execution)
# Type Safety: Composition validated at parse time, runtime type checking
#
# Mathematical Correctness:
#   - Functors preserve structure (type mappings)
#   - Morphisms compose correctly (type flow)
#   - Product distributes over composition
#   - Diagonal functor enables broadcast semantics

# Workflow 3: Combined Full Review (All 4 Analyzers via Nested Products)
# ============================================================================

# Demonstrates nested product composition for 4-way parallel analysis
# Structure: ((SOLID × Security) × (Performance × Coverage))
#
# Note: This requires nested duplicate applications
# duplicate creates (CodeDiff, CodeDiff)
# Then applying duplicate to each creates ((CD, CD), (CD, CD))
#
# For simplicity, we use two separate pipelines instead
# Future work: N-ary broadcast operator for cleaner syntax


# ============================================================================
# Notes on Implementation
# ============================================================================

# 1. Broadcast Semantics:
#    - duplicate creates tuple (CodeDiff, CodeDiff) from single CodeDiff
#    - Product morphism (f × g) applies f to left, g to right in parallel
#    - Result: (SOLIDReport, SecurityReport) from single CodeDiff input
#    - Performance: max(time(f), time(g)) instead of time(f) + time(g)
#
# 2. Type Safety:
#    - All compositions type-checked at validation time
#    - Runtime execution preserves types (functor laws)
#    - Product operator properly unpacks tuple inputs
#    - No runtime type errors possible
#
# 3. Parallel Execution:
#    - Product operators execute concurrently (asyncio.gather)
#    - Each analyzer runs in separate async task
#    - No shared state between analyzers (pure functions)
#    - Scales with available CPU/async resources
#
# 4. Production Integration:
#    - Tasks integrate with multi-agent orchestrator
#    - Real AI models can be swapped in via task executor
#    - Workflow remains mathematically correct regardless of implementation
#    - Composable: workflows can be combined, extended, reused
#
# 5. Future Extensions:
#    - Add more analyzers: (a × b × c) via nested products
#    - Meta-parallelism: (compliance_pipeline × quality_pipeline)
#    - Conditional execution: use coproducts for alternative paths
#    - Error handling: monad transformers for effect composition

# Usage Example (Python)
# ============================================================================

# from src.dsl.use_cases import WorkflowValidator, TypedInterpreter
# from src.dsl.adapters.cli_task_executor import CLITaskExecutor
#
# # Validate workflow
# validator = WorkflowValidator()
# with open('multi_model_code_review.ct', 'r') as f:
#     report = validator.validate_text(f.read())
#
# if report.success:
#     # Execute compliance pipeline
#     executor = CLITaskExecutor()
#     interpreter = TypedInterpreter(
#         task_executor=executor,
#         type_env=report.type_environment,
#         strict=True
#     )
#
#     import asyncio
#     result = asyncio.run(interpreter.execute(compliance_pipeline))
# else:
#     print(report.summary())
