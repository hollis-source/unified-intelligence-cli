# Real CI/CD Pipeline - Actually Run Tests & Checks
# Validates the GPU integration code we just wrote
#
# Flow:
# 1. Parallel quality checks: unit tests, integration tests, linting, format check, type check
# 2. Generate coverage report
# 3. Security scan
# 4. Build verification (ensure package builds)
# 5. Generate CI report
#
# Category Theory: Parallel checks → Sequential reporting
# Real execution: Actually runs pytest, flake8, black, mypy, etc.
