# Local Development Agent Stack (Docker Compose)
# Rapid iteration for agent development
#
# Purpose: Spin up full 12-agent stack locally for development
# Uses docker-compose for orchestration
#
# Flow:
# 1. cleanup_previous: Remove old containers and volumes
# 2. build_dev_images: Build all agent images with dev dependencies
# 3. start_infrastructure: Launch Redis, PostgreSQL, message queue
# 4. start_agents: Launch all 12 agent containers
# 5. run_integration_tests: Verify inter-agent communication
# 6. attach_debugger: Connect remote debugger to agents
#
# Use case: Developer wants to test multi-agent interaction locally
# Time: 5-8 minutes for full stack
