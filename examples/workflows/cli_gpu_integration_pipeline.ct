# CLI GPU Integration Development Pipeline
# Real production example: Add GPU inference support to unified-intelligence-cli
#
# Feature: Deploy Qwen3-8B to Modal/Together.ai for GPU inference
#
# Development Flow (Clean Agile TDD):
# 1. Parallel planning: Research APIs + Design architecture + Write specs
# 2. TDD: Write tests first (unit + integration)
# 3. Implement: GPU adapter + CLI commands + deployment scripts
# 4. CI/CD: Run tests + lint + integration tests + build docs
# 5. Deploy: Package + upload + verify
#
# Category Theory: Planning (parallel) → Tests (parallel) → Implementation (parallel) → CI/CD (sequential) → Deploy
# Estimated time: 15-20 minutes (or 2-3 hours for manual implementation)
