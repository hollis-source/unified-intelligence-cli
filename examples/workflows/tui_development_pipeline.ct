# Textual TUI Development Pipeline
# Real-world example: Add interactive terminal UI to unified-intelligence-cli
#
# Technology: Textual (Rich-based Python TUI framework)
# Purpose: Interactive dashboard for agent orchestration, monitoring, and control
#
# Architecture:
# - Main dashboard with live agent status
# - Task queue visualization with priorities
# - Real-time execution logs
# - Model selection and configuration
# - Training progress monitoring
# - Results browser with syntax highlighting
#
# Flow:
# 1. design_wireframes: Create ASCII mockups of all screens
# 2. setup_textual: Install Textual + dependencies, create base app structure
# 3. Parallel component development (6 components built simultaneously):
#    - build_dashboard: Main screen with agent grid + status indicators
#    - build_task_queue: Priority queue view with filtering
#    - build_agent_monitor: Live log streaming with syntax highlighting
#    - build_model_config: Model selection dropdown + parameter sliders
#    - build_training_view: Progress bars + loss graphs for training
#    - build_results_browser: Tree view + detail pane for task results
# 4. integrate_components: Wire up navigation, state management, event handlers
# 5. add_keybindings: Vim-style navigation (hjkl, /, :, etc.)
# 6. implement_themes: Dark/light mode + syntax highlighting schemes
# 7. performance_test: Ensure <16ms frame time for 60fps
# 8. write_docs: User guide + API documentation
#
# Category Theory: Sequential setup → Parallel builds → Integration
# Total estimated time: 8-12 hours (or 2-3 days for full polish)
