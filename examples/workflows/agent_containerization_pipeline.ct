# Agent Containerization & Scaling Pipeline
# Real-world example: Deploy multi-agent system to Kubernetes cluster
#
# Architecture:
# - 12 specialized agents (python, frontend, backend, devops, etc.)
# - Each agent runs in isolated container
# - Horizontal auto-scaling based on task queue depth
# - Service mesh for inter-agent communication
#
# Flow:
# 1. build_base_image: Create base container with Python + dependencies
# 2. Parallel agent builds: Build 12 agent-specific images concurrently
# 3. test_containers: Run integration tests on all containers
# 4. push_registry: Push validated images to container registry
# 5. Parallel deployment: Deploy to dev and staging simultaneously
# 6. validate_deployment: Health checks and smoke tests
# 7. deploy_production: Final production rollout
# 8. configure_autoscaling: Set up HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)
#
# Category Theory: Multi-level composition with parallel branches
# Total estimated time: 15-25 minutes
