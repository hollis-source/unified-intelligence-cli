# Kubernetes Multi-Agent Deployment Pipeline
# Production-grade deployment with zero-downtime rollout
#
# Components:
# - StatefulSet for agents requiring persistent state
# - Deployment for stateless agents
# - Service mesh (Istio) for inter-agent communication
# - ConfigMaps for agent configurations
# - Secrets for API keys and credentials
# - Persistent volumes for model storage
#
# Flow:
# 1. setup_namespace: Create k8s namespace for agents
# 2. Parallel infrastructure: Deploy configs, secrets, PVs simultaneously
# 3. deploy_service_mesh: Set up Istio for traffic management
# 4. Parallel agent deployments: Deploy all 12 agent types concurrently
# 5. configure_ingress: Set up external access via ingress controller
# 6. enable_monitoring: Deploy Prometheus + Grafana for observability
# 7. run_chaos_tests: Validate resilience (pod failures, network partitions)
#
# This demonstrates DSL handling complex parallel infrastructure deployment
