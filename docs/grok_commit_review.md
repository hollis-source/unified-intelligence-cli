## FINAL ASSESSMENT

After thorough examination of the codebase, including key files like `src/main.py`, `docs/architecture.md`, and `src/use_cases/task_coordinator.py`, the following final observations:

### Strengths:
- **Security**: Proper .env integration for API keys (src/main.py:18-22), no secrets in code, environment variable validation in tests.
- **Performance**: Async patterns throughout (e.g., asyncio.gather in task_coordinator.py:109), timeout handling (main.py:82-89), parallel execution support.
- **Architecture**: Strict adherence to Clean Architecture layers, with composition root in `src/composition.py`, factories for DIP, and adapters for CLI separation.
- **Code Quality**: Methods consistently <20 lines (e.g., task_coordinator.py methods range from 6-19 lines), meaningful names, no duplication.
- **Test Coverage**: 100% passing tests (30 total), including integration tests covering full flows, edge cases, and SOLID validation.

### Minor Suggestions:
- Consider adding more detailed performance metrics in integration tests (e.g., execution time assertions).
- Enhance documentation with examples for new adapters (JSON output formatter).
- Monitor for any drift in method sizes as code evolves.

The project demonstrates excellent Clean Architecture implementation with strong SOLID compliance, comprehensive testing, and production-ready features. All high-priority Grok review items have been addressed.
