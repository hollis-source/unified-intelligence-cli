**Rounds:** 4

## HIGH PRIORITY
1. [Adapters] Implement CLI adapters in the empty src/adapters/cli directory (src/adapters/cli/)
   - Why: The directory is empty despite the project being a CLI tool (README.md:3, src/main.py using Click for CLI); other adapters are partially implemented (e.g., src/adapters/llm/grok_adapter.py:1 for Grok, src/adapters/agent/llm_executor.py:1 for execution), creating an inconsistency in the adapter layer of Clean Architecture.
   - Impact: Ensures proper decoupling of CLI presentation from core use cases (e.g., task_coordinator.py:15 implementing IAgentCoordinator), enabling easier testing and potential GUI extensions while adhering to SOLID's DIP.

2. [Testing] Develop integration tests in the empty tests/integration directory (tests/integration/)
   - Why: Unit tests exist and pass (e.g., tests/unit/test_coordinator_use_case.py:1 with 6479 bytes, 10 tests passed per run_tests), but integration tests are absent; critical for validating async, multi-agent flows in files like task_coordinator.py (240 lines with parallel execution at line 84) and task_planner.py (210 lines).
   - Impact: Prevents integration failures in production, such as LLM provider interactions (e.g., GrokAdapter in src/adapters/llm/grok_adapter.py) with task coordination, ensuring reliability in multi-agent orchestration.

3. [Documentation] Correct UTF-8 encoding error in docs/architecture.md (docs/architecture.md)
   - Why: Reading failed due to invalid byte (0x92 at position 119), blocking access to referenced architecture details (README.md:17); other docs (e.g., grok_architecture_review.md:1) are available but not a substitute.
   - Impact: Restores foundational documentation for Clean Architecture principles (e.g., composition root in src/composition.py:13), facilitating better project maintenance and contributor alignment.

4. [Configuration] Integrate .env file support for environment variables like XAI_API_KEY (src/factories/provider_factory.py:37)
   - Why: Provider factory checks os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY") and raises ValueError if missing (src/factories/provider_factory.py:37-38), but no loading mechanism exists; aligns with security best practices in CLAUDE.md:7, especially for real providers like "grok" (src/main.py:18).
   - Impact: Secures sensitive data handling, enables seamless switching between providers (e.g., mock to grok via ProviderFactory at src/factories/provider_factory.py:42), and avoids runtime errors in production.

## MEDIUM PRIORITY
1. [Architecture] Complete tool support implementations for IToolSupportedProvider interface (src/interfaces/llm_provider.py:43)
   - Why: Interface requires generate_with_tools (src/interfaces/llm_provider.py:49) and supports_tools (src/interfaces/llm_provider.py:72), but search shows only basic MockLLMProvider (src/adapters/llm/mock_provider.py:7); GrokAdapter (src/adapters/llm/grok_adapter.py) likely needs extension, as tool support is defined but not fully realized.
   - Impact: Unlocks advanced agent capabilities (e.g., tool calling in LLMAgentExecutor at src/adapters/agent/llm_executor.py:1), enhancing multi-agent systems without violating ISP, and supporting features like those in task_planner.py.

2. [Documentation] Enhance README.md with detailed CLI usage, examples, and links to docs (README.md:5-9)
   - Why: Content is minimal (17 lines total), omitting examples for options like --parallel (src/main.py:21) or --config (src/main.py:23), and doesn't integrate with docs/ files (e.g., no links to grok_architecture_review.md).
   - Impact: Boosts usability for users and developers, clarifying integrations like agent factories (src/factories/agent_factory.py:1) and promoting the project's multi-agent focus (README.md:3).

3. [Testing] Add coverage reporting (e.g., via pytest-cov in requirements-dev.txt) and aim for >80% coverage
   - Why: Tests pass without coverage metrics; complex components like task_coordinator.py (240 lines, async retries at line 144) and provider_factory.py (66 lines with registry at line 27) need validation to spot untested paths.
   - Impact: Identifies quality gaps in key areas (e.g., execution planning in task_coordinator.py:58), aligning with TDD emphasis in CLAUDE.md:13 and ensuring robust SOLID compliance.

4. [Documentation] Update CLAUDE.md to reflect Grok-centric project and remove Claude-specific content (CLAUDE.md:1-50)
   - Why: File focuses on "Claude-Code Agent" (CLAUDE.md:1) with outdated references (e.g., llama.cpp in CLAUDE.md:34), mismatched with current Grok API usage (src/adapters/llm/grok_adapter.py:1, provider_factory.py:23).
   - Impact: Provides relevant guidance for Grok-based development, reducing confusion in applying Clean Code principles (CLAUDE.md:13) to files like composition.py.

## LOW PRIORITY
1. [Refactoring] Add comprehensive docstrings and type hints to use case methods (e.g., src/use_cases/task_coordinator.py:84)
   - Why: Some comments exist (e.g., src/use_cases/task_coordinator.py:1), but methods like _execute_parallel_group (line 84) lack detailed docstrings; consistent with PEP 8 and type hints in CLAUDE.md:42.
   - Impact: Enhances code maintainability for intricate logic (e.g., retry mechanisms in task_coordinator.py:144), making it easier to extend features like capability selection (src/adapters/agent/capability_selector.py:1).

2. [Enhancements] Utilize the --config CLI option to load configurations dynamically (src/main.py:23-24)
   - Why: Option is defined but not implemented in the main logic (src/main.py:44-97); could parse files for LLMConfig (src/interfaces/llm_provider.py:8) or custom settings in factories (e.g., provider_factory.py:45).
   - Impact: Increases flexibility for users, such as customizing agent behaviors (src/factories/agent_factory.py:1) without code changes.

3. [Version Control] Commit untracked review-related files (e.g., docs/grok_project_todos.md, scripts/grok_review_project.py from git_status)
   - Why: These files (e.g., grok_project_todos.md:129 bytes) contain potential todos and scripts aligned with recent commits (e.g., fb04e06 on refactoring), but remain untracked.
   - Impact: Preserves evidence-based insights from reviews (e.g., similar to docs/week3_refactoring_summary.md), supporting ongoing Clean Architecture iterations.
