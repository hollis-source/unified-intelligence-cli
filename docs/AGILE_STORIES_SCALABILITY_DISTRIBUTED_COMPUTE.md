**Source**: Phase 1 Baseline Analysis + Phase 2 Research Questions
**Priority**: High-value scalability and distributed compute enhancements

## Story 1: Type-Safe Distributed Workflow Composition (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**As a** distributed systems engineer
**I want** DSL composition operators (∘, ×) with type-level guarantees ensuring morphism preservation across async boundaries
**So that** workflow compositions are mathematically correct and fail at compile-time rather than runtime in distributed environments

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. `.ct` workflow files support type annotations for functor composition
2. Parser validates that output type of `f` matches input type of `g` in `g ∘ f`
3. Parallel composition `×` ensures product category laws (projection preservation)
4. Type errors caught during workflow parsing, not execution
5. Test suite: 10+ workflows with type mismatches correctly rejected

**Technical Approach**:
- Extend DSL AST with type system (Hindley-Milner or dependent types)
- Implement category-theoretic type checker verifying functor laws
- Integrate with distributed execution layer (zero-copy data passing safety)

**Estimated Effort**: 8 story points (2-3 sprints)
**Value**: HIGH - Prevents runtime failures in production distributed workflows
**Dependencies**: None (foundational)
**Research Base**: CT (type-level guarantees) + DSL (composition operators) - synergy identified in Phase 2

## Story 2: Horizontal Workflow Orchestration without Centralized Coordinators

**As a** cloud-native deployment engineer
**I want** workflow orchestration to scale horizontally using decentralized coordination patterns
**So that** the system can handle 1000+ concurrent workflows without coordinator bottlenecks

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Implement gossip protocol for task discovery between distributed agents
2. Workflow state stored in distributed hash table (Raft consensus)
3. No single coordinator node - all agents are peers
4. Failure of N-1 nodes does not halt workflow execution
5. Benchmark: 1000 concurrent workflows with <100ms coordination overhead

**Technical Approach**:
- Replace `TaskCoordinatorUseCase` centralized logic with peer-to-peer coordination
- Use Raft for distributed consensus on workflow state
- Implement vector clocks for causality tracking across async boundaries

**Estimated Effort**: 13 story points (3-4 sprints)
**Value**: CRITICAL - Removes primary scalability bottleneck identified in Phase 1
**Dependencies**: Story 1 (type safety ensures distributed correctness)
**Research Base**: DSL (horizontal scaling) + CT (formal verification of distributed invariants)

## Story 3: Monad Transformers for Composable Effect Handling

**As a** workflow developer
**I want** to compose multiple effects (state, error handling, async, backpressure) using monad transformers
**So that** complex distributed workflows remain readable and maintainable

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Implement `StateT`, `ExceptT`, `AsyncT`, `BackpressureT` monad transformers
2. Transformers composable: `BackpressureT (ExceptT (StateT IO))`
3. DSL syntax: `workflow { with_state, with_retry, with_backpressure }`
4. Automatic lifting of effects through transformer stack
5. Test suite: 5+ real-world workflow patterns using 3+ stacked transformers

**Technical Approach**:
- Port Haskell mtl-style monad transformers to Python
- Integrate with DSL parser and interpreter
- Use category-theoretic laws to ensure transformer composition correctness

**Estimated Effort**: 8 story points (2-3 sprints)
**Value**: HIGH - Enables complex distributed patterns with maintainability
**Dependencies**: Story 1 (type system validates transformer stacks)
**Research Base**: CT (monad transformers) + DSL (backpressure/flow control) - direct synergy from Phase 2

## Story 4: Zero-Copy Data Passing with Product Category Formalizations

**As a** performance engineer
**I want** zero-copy data passing between distributed agents formalized using product categories
**So that** multi-gigabyte datasets flow between agents without memory duplication or corruption

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Parallel composition `f × g` uses shared memory for data passing
2. Product projections (`π₁`, `π₂`) guaranteed correct via category laws
3. Type system prevents aliasing bugs (no two agents write to same buffer)
4. Benchmark: 10GB dataset passed between 5 agents with <50MB memory overhead
5. Formal proof that product category implementation satisfies universal property

**Technical Approach**:
- Implement shared memory backend (mmap or Arrow IPC)
- DSL syntax: `(task1 × task2) ⊗ data` for zero-copy parallel execution
- Category-theoretic type system tracks buffer ownership and lifetimes

**Estimated Effort**: 13 story points (3-4 sprints)
**Value**: CRITICAL - Enables big data workflows at scale
**Dependencies**: Stories 1, 2 (type safety + distributed orchestration)
**Research Base**: DSL (zero-copy data passing) + CT (product categories) - highest-value synergy identified

## Story 5: Formal Verification Framework for Fault Tolerance Patterns

**As a** reliability engineer
**I want** fault tolerance patterns (retry, circuit breaker, bulkhead) formally verified against category-theoretic laws
**So that** distributed workflows provably recover from failures without violating correctness invariants

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Retry pattern: proves eventual consistency (monad retry law)
2. Circuit breaker: proves failure isolation (coproduct separation property)
3. Bulkhead: proves resource isolation (limit preservation)
4. Coq/Lean proofs for all three patterns checked in CI/CD
5. Integration tests: inject 100+ failure scenarios, verify no invariant violations

**Technical Approach**:
- Model fault tolerance patterns as category-theoretic structures
- Write Coq/Lean proofs for law satisfaction
- Generate Python code from verified specs (proof-carrying code)

**Estimated Effort**: 21 story points (5-6 sprints)
**Value**: HIGH - Eliminates entire classes of distributed system bugs
**Dependencies**: Stories 1, 3 (type system + monad transformers provide proof foundation)
**Research Base**: CT (formal verification) + DSL (fault tolerance) - synergy from Phase 2

## Research Lineage

**Phase 1 Baseline Analysis** (process 04256c):
- CT: Identified lack of formal verification, missing natural transformations, edge case handling
- DSL: Identified centralized coordinator bottleneck, missing fault tolerance, no distributed data processing

**Phase 2 Research Questions** (process e686b6):
- CT: Explored formal verification, type-level guarantees, product/coproduct categories, monad transformers
- DSL: Explored distributed execution semantics, horizontal scaling, zero-copy data passing, backpressure/flow control

**Synergies Identified**:
1. Type-level guarantees (CT) → Zero-copy data passing safety (DSL) = **Story 1 + Story 4**
2. Monad transformers (CT) → Backpressure/flow control (DSL) = **Story 3**
3. Formal verification (CT) → Fault tolerance patterns (DSL) = **Story 5**
4. Product categories (CT) → Parallel execution (DSL) = **Story 4**

**Cross-Domain Value**: Every story integrates CT mathematical foundations with DSL distributed systems implementation, ensuring both correctness AND scalability.
