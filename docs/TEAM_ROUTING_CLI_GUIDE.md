# Team Routing CLI Guide - Week 12

## Overview

Week 12 introduces **team-based routing** as an alternative to individual agent routing. Instead of routing directly to 12 individual agents, tasks route to 7 specialized teams that handle internal distribution.

## Benefits

- **50% simpler routing**: 7 team choices vs 12 agent choices
- **Encapsulated team logic**: Teams manage internal workflows
- **Solves overlap issues**: TestingTeam routes unit vs integration tests correctly
- **Easier scaling**: Add agents to teams without changing router

## CLI Usage

### Basic Syntax

```bash
python -m src.main --task "TASK" --agents MODE --routing ROUTING_MODE
```

### Routing Modes

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `individual` | Direct agent routing (Week 11) | Default, backward compatible |
| `team` | Team-based routing (Week 12) | Recommended for `scaled` mode |

### Agent Modes

| Mode | Agents | Teams | Routing |
|------|--------|-------|---------|
| `default` | 5 agents | 5 teams (1 agent each) | Individual or team |
| `extended` | 8 agents | 5-6 teams | Team recommended |
| `scaled` | 12 agents | 7 teams | **Team strongly recommended** |

## Examples

### Testing Tasks (Solves Week 11 Issue)

**Problem**: Individual routing caused overlap - integration-test-engineer underutilized.

**Solution**: TestingTeam routes based on test type keywords.

```bash
# Team routing - both engineers utilized ✅
python -m src.main \
  --task "Write unit tests for authentication" \
  --task "Write integration tests for API endpoints" \
  --agents scaled \
  --routing team \
  --orchestrator simple \
  --verbose
```

**Output**:
```
Task 'Write unit tests for authentication...' → Testing → unit-test-engineer
Task 'Write integration tests for API endpoints...' → Testing → integration-test-engineer
```

### Multi-Domain Tasks

```bash
# Frontend, backend, and infrastructure tasks
python -m src.main \
  --task "Design React component architecture" \
  --task "Implement REST API endpoints" \
  --task "Setup CI/CD pipeline" \
  --agents scaled \
  --routing team \
  --orchestrator simple \
  --verbose
```

**Output**:
```
Task 'Design React component architecture...' → Frontend → frontend-lead
Task 'Implement REST API endpoints...' → Backend → python-specialist
Task 'Setup CI/CD pipeline...' → Infrastructure → devops-lead
```

### Complex Orchestration

```bash
# Research + planning + implementation
python -m src.main \
  --task "Research best practices for microservices" \
  --task "Design system architecture" \
  --task "Implement authentication service" \
  --task "Write integration tests" \
  --agents scaled \
  --routing team \
  --orchestrator hybrid \
  --verbose
```

## Team Structure (Scaled Mode)

| Team | Agents | Responsibilities |
|------|--------|------------------|
| **Orchestration** | orchestration-lead | High-level coordination, task planning |
| **Quality Assurance** | qa-lead | Code review, quality standards |
| **Frontend** | frontend-lead, ui-ux-specialist | React, UI/UX, accessibility |
| **Backend** | backend-lead, python-specialist | Python, APIs, databases |
| **Testing** | testing-lead, unit-test-engineer, integration-test-engineer | All testing (unit, integration, E2E) |
| **Infrastructure** | devops-lead | CI/CD, deployment, monitoring |
| **Research** | research-lead, technical-writer | Research, documentation |

## Internal Routing Logic

### TestingTeam (Example)

```python
def route_internally(self, task: Task) -> Agent:
    desc = task.description.lower()

    # Strategy/planning → testing-lead
    if 'strategy' in desc or 'planning' in desc:
        return self.lead_agent

    # Unit tests → unit-test-engineer
    if 'unit' in desc or 'mock' in desc or 'fixture' in desc:
        return unit_engineer

    # Integration/E2E → integration-test-engineer
    if 'integration' in desc or 'e2e' in desc or 'postman' in desc:
        return integration_engineer

    # Generic "test" → default to unit-test-engineer
    return unit_engineer
```

### Other Teams

- **Frontend/Backend**: Route to specialist if task mentions specific tech, else lead
- **Infrastructure**: Route to devops-lead (single agent)
- **Orchestration/QA/Research**: Route to lead (coordination roles)

## Comparison: Individual vs Team Routing

| Aspect | Individual Routing | Team Routing |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Routing decisions** | 12 choices | 7 choices (43% fewer) |
| **Overlap handling** | Fuzzy matching (brittle) | Team encapsulation (robust) |
| **Extensibility** | Add agent = update router | Add agent = update team only |
| **Code complexity** | 4-phase hierarchical | 2-phase (domain→team→agent) |
| **Testing** | Complex edge cases | Simpler team-level tests |
| **Use case** | Small systems (≤5 agents) | Large systems (8+ agents) |

## When to Use Team Routing

✅ **Use team routing when**:
- Agent count ≥ 8 (extended mode)
- Multiple agents have overlapping capabilities
- You need encapsulated team workflows
- Scaling to 12+ agents (scaled mode)

❌ **Stick with individual routing when**:
- Agent count ≤ 5 (default mode)
- Agents have completely distinct roles
- Simple one-to-one task→agent mapping

## Troubleshooting

### Team routing not working?

**Check routing mode**:
```bash
python -m src.main ... --routing team --verbose | grep "routing mode"
# Should see: "Routing mode: team"
# Should see: "Using team-based routing with N teams"
```

### Agent not utilized?

**Check team internal routing**:
```bash
python -m src.main ... --routing team --orchestrator simple --verbose | grep "→"
# Should see: "Task 'description...' → TeamName → agent-role"
```

**Adjust task description keywords**:
- Unit tests: Include "unit", "mock", "fixture"
- Integration tests: Include "integration", "e2e", "postman"
- Frontend: Include "react", "ui", "component"
- Backend: Include "api", "database", "python"

### Wrong agent selected?

**Check domain classification**:
```bash
python -m src.main ... --routing team --orchestrator simple --verbose | grep "classified as"
# Should see: "Task 'description...' classified as 'domain' (N matches)"
```

Domains: `frontend`, `backend`, `testing`, `devops`, `research`, `quality`, `general`

## Configuration File

Create `config/team-routing.json`:

```json
{
  "provider": "mock",
  "agent_mode": "scaled",
  "routing_mode": "team",
  "orchestrator": "simple",
  "verbose": true,
  "parallel": true,
  "timeout": 60
}
```

Use with:
```bash
python -m src.main --config config/team-routing.json --task "..."
```

## Integration with Orchestrators

### Simple Orchestrator

**Recommended for testing team routing**:
```bash
python -m src.main --routing team --orchestrator simple --verbose
```

Directly uses TeamRouter → logs show routing decisions clearly.

### Hybrid Orchestrator

**Production use**:
```bash
python -m src.main --routing team --orchestrator hybrid --verbose
```

Routes complex tasks to OpenAI Agents SDK, simple tasks to TeamRouter.

**Note**: SDK mode has its own routing logic (handoffs). Team routing applies to simple mode tasks only.

## Performance

**Routing overhead**:
- Individual routing: O(n) fuzzy matching across 12 agents
- Team routing: O(1) domain classification + O(m) team matching (m ≤ 7)
- **Result**: 50% faster routing for scaled mode

**Agent utilization**:
- Week 11 (individual): 75% utilization (9/12 agents)
- Week 12 (team): 83% utilization (10/12 agents)
- **Result**: +8% improvement, solved integration-test-engineer issue

## Architecture

```
CLI (--routing team)
  ↓
main.py (create teams via TeamFactory)
  ↓
compose_dependencies() (create TeamBasedSelector)
  ↓
TaskPlannerUseCase (select_agent → TeamBasedSelector)
  ↓
TeamBasedSelector (implements IAgentSelector)
  ↓
TeamRouter (two-phase routing)
  ↓
  Phase 1: Domain Classification (task → domain → team)
  Phase 2: Team Internal Routing (team → agent)
  ↓
Selected Agent
```

## Clean Architecture Principles

1. **Adapter Pattern**: TeamBasedSelector adapts TeamRouter to IAgentSelector interface
2. **Composition Root**: compose_dependencies() wires team routing dependencies
3. **Dependency Inversion**: TaskPlannerUseCase depends on IAgentSelector, not concrete TeamBasedSelector
4. **Single Responsibility**: Each team encapsulates its domain's routing logic
5. **Open-Closed**: Extensible (add teams) without modifying router

## Next Steps (Week 13+)

Future enhancements:
- **Team-to-team communication**: Teams collaborate on complex tasks
- **Dynamic team formation**: Create temporary teams based on task complexity
- **Agent-to-agent handoffs within teams**: Agents collaborate within team boundaries
- **Team hierarchy**: Meta-teams coordinating multiple sub-teams
