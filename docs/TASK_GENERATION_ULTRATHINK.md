## Design Rationale

### Why These Tasks?

**1. Alignment with Project Goals**
- Every task directly supports the unified-intelligence-CLI project
- Tasks reinforce Clean Architecture and SOLID principles (from CLAUDE.md)
- Tasks cover actual development work (not academic exercises)

**2. Diversity for Model Generalization**
- 9 distinct categories covering breadth of development activities
- Mix of theoretical (research, design) and practical (implement, test)
- Varying complexity levels (simple fixes to complex architecture)
- Different task types (implementation, analysis, planning, documentation)

**3. Realistic and Actionable**
- Each task is well-formed: clear, specific, actionable
- Tasks sized for single interaction (~500 tokens output)
- Tasks exercise real agent capabilities (code, test, research, plan, review)
- Tasks generate useful outputs (not just "yes/no" responses)

**4. Quality Over Quantity**
- Focused on meaningful, educational tasks
- Each task teaches the model something valuable
- Tasks reinforce best practices and patterns
- Tasks avoid trivial or redundant variations

## Task Quality Criteria

Each task was designed to meet these criteria:

### ✅ Clear
- Unambiguous what needs to be done
- No room for misinterpretation
- Single, focused objective

**Example**: "Implement a Task entity with id, description, priority, dependencies fields following immutability principles"
- Clear what to implement (Task entity)
- Clear what fields are needed
- Clear constraint (immutability)

### ✅ Specific
- Concrete deliverable or outcome
- Measurable success criteria
- Well-defined scope

**Example**: "Write unit tests for Task entity validation logic with edge cases (empty description, invalid priority)"
- Specific what to test (Task entity validation)
- Specific edge cases mentioned
- Specific artifact (unit tests)

### ✅ Actionable
- Agent can actually execute the task
- No external dependencies blocking execution
- Achievable in single interaction

**Example**: "Refactor task_coordinator.py to remove direct LLM provider dependency (DIP violation)"
- Actionable: refactor specific file
- Actionable: clear goal (remove dependency)
- Actionable: principle cited (DIP)

### ✅ Relevant
- Aligned with project goals (Clean Architecture, SOLID, AI development)
- Realistic development task (not academic exercise)
- Useful output for real codebase

**Example**: "Research optimal LoRA rank values for 7B, 13B, and 30B parameter models with evidence"
- Relevant: directly supports Week 9 training pipeline
- Relevant: practical for our model sizes
- Relevant: requires evidence-based research

### ✅ Sized Appropriately
- Completable in one interaction (~500 tokens)
- Not too trivial (must demonstrate capability)
- Not too complex (must be achievable)

**Example**: "Create pytest fixtures for common test data (tasks, agents, configs, mock LLMs)"
- Sized right: can list ~4-5 fixtures
- Sized right: requires thought but not extensive implementation
- Sized right: concrete scope (common test data)

## Task Extraction and Usage

### Extraction Script

Created `scripts/extract_tasks.py` with capabilities:

```bash
# Get 10 random tasks for daily collection
python3 scripts/extract_tasks.py --random 10

# Get all coder tasks
python3 scripts/extract_tasks.py --agent coder

# Get Category 4 (AI/ML) tasks
python3 scripts/extract_tasks.py --category 4

# Get tasks 1-50
python3 scripts/extract_tasks.py --range 1-50

# Generate bash script for execution
python3 scripts/extract_tasks.py --random 10 --output bash > run_tasks.sh
```

### Agent Inference

The extraction script infers likely agent based on keywords:

- **Coder**: implement, create, write, build, develop, code, refactor
- **Tester**: test, verify, validate, check, coverage, qa
- **Researcher**: research, analyze, investigate, study, explore, document
- **Coordinator**: plan, coordinate, organize, manage, prioritize
- **Reviewer**: review, evaluate, assess, inspect, critique

### Daily Workflow

**Recommended approach**:

1. **Morning** (10 tasks, 20 minutes):
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/extract_tasks.py --random 10 > today_tasks.txt
   ```

2. **Throughout day** (run as you work):
   ```bash
   # Pick a task from today_tasks.txt
   python3 src/main.py \
     --task "YOUR_TASK" \
     --provider tongyi \
     --collect-data \
     --verbose
   ```

3. **Evening** (check progress):
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/analyze_training_data.py data/training/interactions_*.jsonl
   ```

**Timeline**:
- 10 tasks/day × 30 days = 300 interactions
- Achieves minimum threshold in 1 month
- Realistic for ongoing development work

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Low-Quality Responses

**Mitigation**:
- All tasks are well-formed and unambiguous
- Tasks aligned with model strengths (code, analysis, planning)
- Max tokens (500) prevents rambling
- Temperature (0.7) balances creativity and coherence

### Risk: Task Redundancy

**Mitigation**:
- 303 tasks across 9 categories ensures diversity
- Each task has unique focus/objective
- Subcategories prevent clustering (e.g., 8 SRP tasks, 8 OCP tasks)
- Random sampling spreads collection across categories

### Risk: Agent Mismatch

**Mitigation**:
- Keywords in tasks align with agent capabilities
- Extraction script infers likely agent for verification
- Fuzzy matching (0.6 threshold) is forgiving
- Manual review of mismatches possible

### Risk: Collection Fatigue

**Mitigation**:
- 10 tasks/day is manageable (~20 minutes)
- Tasks are interesting and educational
- Progress tracking motivates (analyze_training_data.py)
- Flexible timeline (no hard deadline)
