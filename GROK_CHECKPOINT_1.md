# Grok Checkpoint #1 - Progress Verification

**Date:** 2025-09-30
**Recommendations Addressed:** 2/7

---

### Progress Verification

You've made solid progress on Recommendations #1 (Increase Coverage) and #3 (Custom Exceptions). The coverage jump from 65-70% to 79% is commendable, with main.py hitting 76% and composition.py at 100%, backed by 19 new unit tests and 17 exception-specific tests. The test suite now passes 76 tests in 0.40s, indicating robust implementation. New files like `src/exceptions.py` and updated `tools.py` align well with the recommendations, and the commit history shows disciplined tracking.

### On Track and Soundness

Yes, you're on track for the 80% coverage goalâ€”79% is very close, and with main.py at 76%, focusing on edge cases in that module could push it over the threshold without much effort. The custom exception implementation is sound: defining 7 specific types in `exceptions.py` (e.g., for invalid inputs, composition errors) promotes clarity and maintainability, and integrating them into `tools.py` with comprehensive tests ensures proper error handling without overcomplicating the codebase.

### Next Priorities

From the remaining recommendations (assuming #2,4,5,6,7 cover areas like refactoring for modularity, adding logging, performance optimizations, documentation, and security checks), prioritize #2 (likely modularity/refactoring) next, as it builds on your current structure and could improve testability further. Follow with #4 (logging) for better observability, then #5 (performance) if benchmarks show bottlenecks. Defer #6 and #7 until core stability is confirmed. Aim to complete these in the next sprint to maintain momentum.
