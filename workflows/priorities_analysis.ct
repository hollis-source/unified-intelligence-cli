# Priorities Analysis Workflow
# Uses DSL composition + CLI multi-agent orchestration to determine next steps

# Type signatures for priority analysis tasks
analyze_current_state :: () -> StateAnalysis
assess_dsl_priorities :: () -> DSLPriorities
assess_sprint_priorities :: () -> SprintPriorities
evaluate_syd2_synergy :: () -> SYD2Synergy
synthesize_recommendation :: (StateAnalysis × DSLPriorities × SprintPriorities × SYD2Synergy) -> FinalRecommendation

# Parallel analysis phase using broadcast operator (**)
# Each team analyzes independently and concurrently
parallel_analysis = analyze_current_state ** assess_dsl_priorities ** assess_sprint_priorities ** evaluate_syd2_synergy

# Sequential composition: gather analyses → synthesize recommendation
# Product (×) takes tuple of results, functor (o) chains the pipeline
functor priorities_workflow = synthesize_recommendation o parallel_analysis

# Expected result: Prioritized implementation plan with clear next steps
