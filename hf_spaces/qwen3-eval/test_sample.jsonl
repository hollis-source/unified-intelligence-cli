Mock provider tests:\n\t* Test that the LLM provider returns the expected data for a given input.\n\t* Test that the LLM provider handles invalid input data and returns the appropriate error message.\n\t* Test that the LLM provider handles edge cases, such as empty input or input with special characters.\n2. Grok provider tests:\n\t* Test that the LLM provider returns the expected data for a given input.\n\t* Test that the LLM provider handles invalid input data and returns the appropriate error message.\n\t* Test that the LLM provider handles edge cases, such as empty input or input with special characters.\n\t* Test that the LLM provider correctly parses and returns data in the expected format.\n3. Tongyi provider tests:\n\t* Test that the LLM provider returns the expected data for a given input.\n\t* Test that the LLM provider handles invalid input data and returns the appropriate error message.\n\t* Test that the LLM provider handles edge cases, such as empty input or input with special characters.\n\t* Test that the LLM provider correctly parses and returns data in the expected format.\n4. Provider switching tests:\n\t* Test that the LLM provider can switch between mock, grok, and tongyi providers without errors.\n\t* Test that the LLM provider returns the expected data for a given input when switching between providers.\n\t* Test that the LLM provider handles errors and edge cases when switching between providers.\n\nTo write these tests, we can use a testing framework such as Jest or Pytest, depending on the programming language we're using. We can also use mocking libraries such as Mockk or Mockito to mock the LLM provider's behavior and test its responses.\n\nAdditionally, we can use a testing library such as TestNG or JUnit to write and run the tests. These libraries provide useful features such as test suites, test cases, assertions, and test runners, which can help us write\n<|im_end|>", "task_id": "task_1", "agent": "coder", "status": "success"}

Define the configuration format:\nYAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization format that is easy to read and write. We can use YAML to define the configuration for our DI system.\n2. Choose a YAML parsing library:\nThere are several YAML parsing libraries available for different programming languages. For example, in Python, we can use the `yaml` library to parse YAML files.\n3. Define the configuration structure:\nWe can define a configuration structure that includes the necessary information for the DI system. For example, we can define a `components` section that lists all the components in the system, and a `dependencies` section that defines the dependencies between components.\n4. Load the configuration from YAML files:\nWe can load the configuration from YAML files using the YAML parsing library. We can define a function that takes the path to the YAML file as an argument, parses the file, and returns the configuration data.\n5. Build the DI graph:\nOnce we have the configuration data, we can build the DI graph. We can define a function that takes the configuration data as an argument, and creates the DI graph using a DI container. The DI container is responsible for managing the dependencies between components.\n6. Validate the configuration:\nBefore building the DI graph, we can validate the configuration data to ensure that it is correct and consistent. We can define a function that checks the configuration data for errors and inconsistencies, and returns an error message if any issues are found.\n7. Test the DI system:\nOnce the DI system is built, we can test it to ensure that it works correctly. We can define test cases that cover different scenarios, such as resolving dependencies, injecting dependencies, and checking the DI graph.\n\nHere's an example of how the configuration structure might look like:\n```yaml\ncomponents:\n  - name: ComponentA\n    dependencies:\n      - ComponentB\n      - ComponentC\n  - name: ComponentB\n    dependencies:\n      - ComponentD\n  - name: ComponentC\n    dependencies:\n<|im_end|>", "task_id": "task_1", "agent": "tester", "status": "success"}

Define the error handling strategies: First, we need to identify the different error handling strategies that we want to support. For example, we might have a strategy for handling authentication errors, another for handling database connection errors, and so on.\n2. Create a plugin architecture: Next, we can create a plugin architecture that allows developers to implement their own error handling strategies. Each plugin would need to implement a common interface that defines the methods for handling errors.\n3. Define the extension points: We can define extension points in our system that allow developers to plug in their error handling strategies. For example, we might define an extension point for handling authentication errors, another for handling database connection errors, and so on.\n4. Implement the plugin loading mechanism: We need to implement a mechanism that loads the appropriate plugins at runtime. We can use a plugin framework such as Spring Boot's plugin mechanism or Apache Spark's plugin mechanism to simplify the process.\n5. Implement the error handling strategies: Once the plugins are loaded, we can implement the error handling strategies in our system. Each strategy would need to handle the errors in a way that is appropriate for the specific error type.\n6. Test the system: Finally, we need to test the system to ensure that it works as expected. We can write test cases that cover different error scenarios and verify that the appropriate error handling strategy is called.\n\nHere's an example of how this might look in code:\n```\n// Define the error handling strategies\npublic interface ErrorHandler {\n  void handleError(Error error);\n}\n\npublic class AuthenticationErrorHandler implements ErrorHandler {\n  @Override\n  public void handleError(Error error) {\n    // Handle authentication errors\n  }\n}\n\npublic class DatabaseConnectionErrorHandler implements ErrorHandler {\n  @Override\n  public void handleError(Error error) {\n    // Handle database connection errors\n  }\n}\n\n// Define the extension points\npublic interface ErrorHandlerExtensionPoint {\n  void handleError(Error error);\n}\n\n// Implement the plugin loading mechanism\npublic class PluginLoader {\n  private Map<String, ErrorHandlerExtensionPoint> plugins = new\n<|im_end|>", "task_id": "task_1", "agent": "coordinator", "status": "success"}

Metrics: This involves collecting data on various aspects of the system, such as performance metrics (e.g., response time, throughput), error rates, and other relevant metrics. The data can be collected using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or New Relic.\n2. Logging: This involves capturing detailed information about the system's behavior, such as logs from different components, error messages, and other relevant data. Logging tools like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk, or Sumo Logic can be used for this purpose.\n3. Alerting: This involves setting up alerts based on the metrics and logging data, so that the team can be notified when certain thresholds are exceeded or when unusual behavior is detected. Alerting tools like PagerDuty, OpsGenie, or VictorOps can be used for this purpose.\n4. Refactoring: This involves improving the existing codebase to make it more efficient, readable, and maintainable. Refactoring can help improve performance, reduce technical debt, and make it easier to add new features.\n5. Debugging: This involves identifying and fixing issues in the code, such as bugs, errors, or performance issues. Debugging tools like Visual Studio Code, Chrome DevTools, or Eclipse can be used for this purpose.\n6. Optimization: This involves improving the performance of the system, such as reducing response time, improving throughput, or optimizing resource utilization. Optimization can be achieved through techniques like caching, parallel processing, or database optimization.\n7. Improvement: This involves identifying areas for improvement in the system, such as user experience, security, or scalability. Improvements can be made by implementing new features, updating existing functionality, or enhancing the user interface.\n\nI hope this helps!

Identify the complex objects: Start by identifying the complex objects that require test data builders. These could be objects with multiple properties, nested objects, or objects with custom validation rules.\n2. Define the test data builder interface: Create an interface for the test data builder that defines the methods for building the test data. This interface should be implemented by all test data builders for the complex objects.\n3. Create test data builder classes: Create separate classes for each complex object that implements the test data builder interface. Each class should have a fluent interface that allows for the creation of test data in a readable and intuitive way.\n4. Define the build method: The build method is the main method that will create the test data. This method should return the fully populated test data object.\n5. Define additional methods: Depending on the complexity of the object, you may need to define additional methods to help with the creation of test data. For example, you may need methods to create nested objects or to set specific properties.\n6. Use the test data builders: Once the test data builders are created, you can use them to create test data for your tests. You can use the fluent interface to create the test data in a readable and intuitive way.\n\nHere's an example of how this could look like:\n```\npublic interface TestDataBuilder<T> {\n    T build();\n}\n\npublic class CustomerTestDataBuilder implements TestDataBuilder<Customer> {\n    private String name;\n    private String email;\n    private Address address;\n\n    public CustomerTestDataBuilder withName(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n        return this;\n    }\n\n    public CustomerTestDataBuilder withEmail(String email) {\n        this.email = email;\n        return this;\n    }\n\n    public CustomerTestDataBuilder withAddress(Address address) {\n        this.address = address;\n        return this;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Customer build() {\n        Customer customer = new Customer();\n        customer.setName(name);\n        customer.setEmail(email);\n<|im_end|>", "task_id": "task_1", "agent": "tester", "status": "success"}

The State pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. In the context of task lifecycle management, we can use the State pattern to manage the different stages of a task's lifecycle.\n\nHere's an example of how we can implement the State pattern for task lifecycle management:\n\n1. Define the states: First, we need to define the different states that a task can be in. For example, we might have the following states:\n\t* New: The task has just been created and is waiting to be assigned to a worker.\n\t* Assigned: The task has been assigned to a worker, but it has not yet been started.\n\t* In Progress: The worker is currently working on the task.\n\t* Completed: The task has been completed and is waiting to be reviewed.\n\t* Reviewed: The task has been reviewed and is waiting to be approved or rejected.\n\t* Approved: The task has been approved and is ready to be closed.\n\t* Rejected: The task has been rejected and needs to be reworked or cancelled.\n2. Define the transitions: Next, we need to define the transitions between the states. For example, we might have the following transitions:\n\t* New -> Assigned: When a worker is assigned to the task, it transitions from the New state to the Assigned state.\n\t* Assigned -> In Progress: When the worker starts working on the task, it transitions from the Assigned state to the In Progress state.\n\t* In Progress -> Completed: When the worker finishes the task, it transitions from the In Progress state to the Completed state.\n\t* Completed -> Reviewed: When the task is completed, it transitions from the Completed state to the Reviewed state.\n\t* Reviewed -> Approved or Rejected: When the task is reviewed, it transitions from the Reviewed state to either the Approved or Rejected state, depending on the outcome of the review.\n3. Define the actions: Finally, we need to define the actions that can be performed on each state. For example, we might have the following actions:\n\t* New: Create, Assign\n<|im_end|>", "task_id": "task_1", "agent": "coordinator", "status": "success"}

Create the `ISerializer` interface with a method for serializing objects to JSON:\n```typescript\ninterface ISerializer {\n  serialize(obj: any): string;\n}\n```\n1. Implement the `ISerializer` interface in a concrete serializer class, e.g. `JsonSerializer`:\n```typescript\nclass JsonSerializer implements ISerializer {\n  serialize(obj: any): string {\n    // implement JSON serialization logic here\n    return JSON.stringify(obj);\n  }\n}\n```\n1. Inject an instance of the `ISerializer` interface into the class that needs to perform JSON serialization, e.g. `MyClass`:\n```typescript\nclass MyClass {\n  constructor(private serializer: ISerializer) {}\n\n  serializeObject(obj: any): string {\n    return this.serializer.serialize(obj);\n  }\n}\n```\n1. Use the `MyClass` class to serialize objects to JSON:\n```typescript\nconst myClass = new MyClass(new JsonSerializer());\nconst json = myClass.serializeObject({ foo: 'bar' });\nconsole.log(json);\n```\nThis approach allows us to decouple the serialization logic from the class that needs to perform serialization, making it easier to switch between different serialization implementations if needed.\n\nNote that this is just one way to implement the `ISerializer` interface, and there are many other ways to do it. The important thing is to define the interface and its methods in a way that makes sense for your specific use case.\n<|im_end|>", "task_id": "task_1", "agent": "coder", "status": "success"}

Since the actual codebase is not provided, we will assume a typical structure for a CLI application built with Clean Architecture principles. We'll break down the layers, identify dependencies, evaluate adherence, and then suggest improvements.\n\nAssumed Layers:\n1. Entities (Domain Layer): Contains core business objects and rules.\n2. Use Cases (Interactors): Application-specific business logic (use cases) that orchestrate the flow.\n3. Adapters:\n   - Frameworks & Drivers (Infrastructure): External dependencies (e.g., database, web services).\n   - Controllers (API): The entry points (e.g., CLI commands).\n\nDependencies:\n- Entities are independent and should have no dependencies on other layers.\n- Use Cases depend on Entities (for business rules) and may depend on adapters (for infrastructure) via interfaces (ports).\n- Adapters (Infrastructure) depend on Use Cases and Entities via interfaces (ports). They implement the interfaces defined by the application layer.\n\nClean Architecture Principles:\n- Separation of Concerns: Each layer has a distinct responsibility.\n- Dependency Rule: Dependencies point inward. Higher layers (more abstract) should not depend on lower layers (more concrete). Instead, lower layers depend on abstractions (interfaces) defined in higher layers.\n- Inversion of Control: The flow of control is managed by the application (use cases) and not by external frameworks.\n\nPotential Improvements:\n1. Ensure that the dependency rule is strictly followed: Use cases should not depend on concrete infrastructure, but on abstractions (ports). Infrastructure should implement those abstractions.\n2. Entities should be pure and free of external framework dependencies (e.g., no JPA annotations in entities if they are for persistence).\n3. Use cases should not contain any application-specific logic that is not business-related (e.g., logging, error handling) unless it's part of the business.\n4. The CLI controller should be thin and only handle input/output, delegating the business logic to use cases.\n\nLet's assume we have a simple CLI that fetches user data from a service and displays it.\n\nExample Structure:\n\nentities/\n  user.py\n  user.py (contains User class)\n\nuse_cases/\n  get_user_use_case.py\n  get_user_request_model.py\n\nadapters/\n  frameworks_and_drivers/\n    database/\n      user_repository.py\n    external_service/\n      user_service.py\n  controllers/\n    cli/\n      commands/\n<|im_end|>", "task_id": "task_1", "agent": "coder", "status": "success"}

It's a useful tool for managing projects and workflows, but it can be quite complex. To make it more manageable, we can split it into two separate components: TaskAnalyzer and ExecutionPlanner.\n\nTaskAnalyzer will be responsible for analyzing the task and breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts. This will include things like identifying the specific steps involved in the task, estimating the time and resources required, and identifying any potential roadblocks or dependencies.\n\nExecutionPlanner, on the other hand, will take the output from TaskAnalyzer and use it to create a detailed plan for executing the task. This will include things like scheduling resources, assigning tasks to team members, and setting deadlines.\n\nBy splitting TaskPlannerUseCase into these two components, we can make the task planning and execution process more efficient and manageable. It will also allow us to focus on specific aspects of the task, such as analysis and planning, which can help to improve overall productivity and accuracy.\n\nHere's an example of how we might implement this split:\n\n1. First, we'll create a new component called TaskAnalyzer. This component will take in a task as input and analyze it to identify the specific steps involved, estimate the time and resources required, and identify any potential roadblocks or dependencies.\n2. Next, we'll create a new component called ExecutionPlanner. This component will take the output from TaskAnalyzer and use it to create a detailed plan for executing the task. This will include things like scheduling resources, assigning tasks to team members, and setting deadlines.\n3. Finally, we'll modify TaskPlannerUseCase to use the output from TaskAnalyzer and ExecutionPlanner to create a comprehensive plan for executing the task.\n\nBy following this approach, we can create a more modular and manageable system that is better equipped to handle complex tasks and projects.\n<|im_end|>", "task_id": "task_1", "agent": "researcher", "status": "success"}

In this case, we're interested in execution time, tokens, and costs.\n2. Determine the data sources: Next, we need to identify where we can source the data for these metrics. For example, we might use a stopwatch or a timer to measure execution time, and we might use an API or a database to retrieve token usage and cost data.\n3. Choose a data storage solution: Once we have identified the data sources, we need to choose a data storage solution that can handle the volume and complexity of the data we're collecting. This could be a relational database, a NoSQL database, or a data warehouse.\n4. Design the data pipeline: After selecting a data storage solution, we need to design a data pipeline that can collect, process, and store the data efficiently. This might involve using data integration tools, such as Apache NiFi or AWS Glue, to extract, transform, and load the data into the data storage solution.\n5.

We will log the input and output of the GenerateText method, along with any relevant metadata (like timestamps, operation name, etc.).\n 4. We assume we have a logging framework (like Serilog, NLog, or ILogger from Microsoft.Extensions.Logging) available.\n\n Let's assume we are using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.

To implement a --format option that supports JSON, YAML, table, and markdown outputs, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. First, you'll need to define the --format option in your program's CLI (Command Line Interface) arguments. You can do this by using a library like argparse in Python, which allows you to define command line arguments and their corresponding options.\n2. Once you've defined the --format option, you'll need to write code that can handle each of the output formats you want to support. For example, you can use a library like json to handle JSON output, a library like yaml to handle YAML output, and a library like tabulate to handle table output. For markdown output, you can use a library like markdown2 or mistune.\n3. Next, you'll need to write code that takes the input data and converts it into the desired output format. This will involve using the appropriate library to serialize the data into the format you want. For example, if you're using JSON, you can use the json.dumps() function to convert the data into a JSON string.\n4. Finally, you'll need to output the formatted data to the console or a file.

This can be useful for task progress notifications, where you want to notify a set of observers (such as a user interface or a logging system) when the task's progress changes.\n\nHere's an example of how you might implement the Observer pattern in JavaScript:\n```\nclass Task {\n  private observers = [];\n\n  constructor() {\n    this.progress = 0;\n  }\n\n  registerObserver(observer) {\n    this.observers.push(observer);\n  }\n\n  removeObserver(observer) {\n    const index = this.observers.indexOf(observer);\n    if (index !== -1) {\n      this.observers.splice(index, 1);\n    }\n  }\n\n  notifyObservers() {\n    this.observers.forEach((observer) => {\n      observer.update(this.progress);\n    });\n  }\n\n  updateProgress(progress) {\n    this.progress = progress;\n    this.notifyObservers();\n  }\n}\n\nclass UserInterface {\n  constructor() {\n    this.task = new Task();\n  }\n\n  update(progress) {\n    console.log(`Task progress: ${progress}`);\n  }\n}\n\nconst task = new Task();\nconst ui = new UserInterface();\n\ntask.registerObserver(ui);\n\ntask.updateProgress(50); // Output: Task progress: 50\n\ntask.updateProgress(100); // Output: Task progress: 100\n\ntask.removeObserver(ui);\n\ntask.updateProgress(75); // Output: No output\n```\nIn this example, the `Task` class has a private `observers` array that stores references to objects that implement the `update` method. The `registerObserver` method adds an observer to the `observers` array, and the `removeObserver` method removes an observer from the `observers` array. The `notifyObservers` method loops through the\n<|im_end|>", "task_id": "task_1", "agent": "coder", "status": "success"}

Identify the class invariants: These are the attributes or properties of a class that are always true or always hold a certain value. For example, a class invariant for a `Point` class might be that the x-coordinate is always non-negative.\n2. Identify the preconditions: These are the conditions that must be true before a certain method or function can be called. For example, a precondition for a `sort` method might be that the list of items to be sorted is not empty.\n3. Document the class invariants and preconditions in the docstrings: We can use natural language to describe the class invariants and preconditions in the docstrings. For example:\n```\nclass Point:\n    \"\"\"\n    A point in 2D space.\n\n    Class invariants:\n        x: Non-negative real number\n        y: Non-negative real number\n\n    Preconditions:\n        x: Valid real number\n        y: Valid real number\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes a new point.\n\n        Preconditions:\n            x: Valid real number\n            y: Valid real number\n        \"\"\"\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n\n    def distance_to(self, other):\n        \"\"\"\n        Returns the distance between this point and the other point.\n\n        Preconditions:\n            other: Point\n        \"\"\"\n        # Calculate the distance\n        return math.sqrt((self.x - other.x)**2 + (self.y - other.y)**2)\n```\nIn this example, we've documented the class invariants and preconditions for the `Point` class and its methods. This will help other developers understand the assumptions and constraints of the class, and ensure that they use it correctly.\n\nI hope this helps!

Define an interface for the agent (or base class) that all plugins must adhere to.\n 2. The core will have a mechanism to discover and load plugins (e.g., by scanning a directory, using entry points, etc.).\n 3. Each plugin will be a separate module that implements the agent interface and registers itself with the core.\n\n We'll use Python for this example.\n\n Let's assume we have an abstract base class `Agent` that defines the interface.\n\n Example:\n   class Agent(ABC):\n       @abstractmethod\n       def act(self, state):\n           pass\n\n Then, we can have plugins that define their own agent types by subclassing `Agent`.\n\n How the core discovers plugins?\n   We can use a registry pattern. The core will have a registry (a dictionary) that maps agent names to agent classes.\n\n   We can have a base plugin class that plugins must inherit from, which automatically registers the agent.\n\n Alternatively, we can use entry points (like setuptools entry points) but for simplicity, we'll use a registry.\n\n However, note: we don't want to modify the core when adding plugins. So the core should have a way to load plugins without knowing them.\n\n Approach 1: The core provides a base class that plugins must inherit from, and then the plugin's class is automatically registered.\n\n   class AgentRegistry:\n        _agents = {}\n\n        @classmethod\n        def register_agent(cls, agent_class):\n            cls._agents[agent_class.name] = agent_class\n\n        @classmethod\n        def get_agent(cls, name):\n            return cls._agents.get(name)\n\n   Then, in the plugin, we can define:\n\n        from core.agent import Agent, AgentRegistry\n\n        class MyAgent(Agent):\n            name = \"my_agent\"\n\n        AgentRegistry.register_agent(MyAgent)\n\n   But note: the plugin must know about the core's registry. Also, the core must provide the base class and registry.\n\n Approach 2: The core scans a directory for agent classes. This requires that plugins are in a specific location and follow a naming convention.\n\n Approach 3: Use entry points (setuptools) which is the standard way for Python plugins.\n\n Let's go with a\n<|im_end|>", "task_id": "task_1", "agent": "coder", "status": "success"}

An IModelProvider interface is a contract that defines a set of methods that a class must implement to provide a way for a Large Language Model (LLM) to access and manipulate the model's internal state.\n\nHere's an example of what the IModelProvider interface might look like:\n```\npublic interface IModelProvider {\n    void setModel(Model model);\n    Model getModel();\n    void updateModel(Model model);\n    void disposeModel();\n}\n```\nNow, let's talk about how we can abstract the LLM implementation details using this interface.\n\nOne way to do this is to create a class that implements the IModelProvider interface and passes the implementation details to the LLM. Here's an example of what this class might look like:\n```\npublic class ModelProvider implements IModelProvider {\n    private final LLM _llm;\n\n    public ModelProvider(LLM lLM) {\n        _llm = lLM;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void setModel(Model model) {\n        _llm.setModel(model);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Model getModel() {\n        return _llm.getModel();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void updateModel(Model model) {\n        _llm.updateModel(model);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void disposeModel() {\n        _llm.disposeModel();\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class takes in an LLM object in its constructor and implements the IModelProvider interface. It then passes the implementation details to the LLM object, which can be used to access and manipulate the model's internal state.\n\nBy using this approach, we can decouple the LLM implementation details from the rest of the code and make it easier to switch between different LLM implementations.\n\nI hope this helps!

A cancellation token (or similar) that can be used to signal cancellation.\n 2. Cleanup hooks that can be registered to perform necessary cleanup when cancellation is requested.\n\n We'll implement this in Python, but the concept is language-agnostic.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Define a cancellation token that has a state (not cancelled vs cancelled) and a method to cancel.\n 2. The token should also allow registering cleanup functions that will be called when the token is cancelled.\n 3. We can design a context manager for the token to handle the cleanup in a controlled way, but note that the token itself is stateful.\n\n Alternatively, we can have a function that takes a cancellation token and a list of cleanup functions, and then we can cancel the token to trigger the cleanup.\n\n However, note that the problem does not specify the context (e.g., async, threads, etc.). We'll assume a single-threaded context for simplicity.\n\n Let's design:\n\n Class: CancellationToken\n   - state: boolean (initially False)\n   - callbacks: list of functions to call on cancellation\n\n   Methods:\n     - cancel(): set state to True and call all callbacks.\n     - is_cancelled(): return state\n\n We can also have a context manager that automatically cancels when exiting, but note that we don't want to cancel on normal exit? Actually, the cancellation token is for external cancellation.\n\n Alternatively, we can have a function that uses the token and checks the state periodically.\n\n Example usage:\n\n   token = CancellationToken()\n\n   def cleanup1():\n      print(\"Cleaning up 1\")\n\n   token.register(cleanup1)\n\n   ... do some work ...\n\n   if token.is_cancelled():\n      token.cancel()   # This will call cleanup1\n\n But note: we might want to cancel without checking?

To implement a structured error hierarchy with specific exception types for each failure mode, we can follow a few steps:\n\n1. Identify the different failure modes: The first step is to identify the different ways in which our system can fail. For example, we might have failure modes like \"Invalid Input,\" \"Network Connection Failure,\" \"Data Storage Error,\" etc.\n2. Define exception classes: Once we have identified the failure modes, we can define exception classes for each one. These classes should be named in a way that clearly communicates the type of error that occurred. For example, we might define exception classes like \"InvalidInputException,\" \"NetworkConnectionException,\" \"DataStorageException,\" etc.\n3. Define the hierarchy: Next, we need to define the hierarchy of our exception classes. This hierarchy should reflect the relationship between the different failure modes. For example, we might have a base class called \"Exception\" that all other exception classes inherit from. We might also have a hierarchy of exception classes like this:\n```\nException\n|\n+---InvalidInputException\n|\n+---NetworkConnectionException\n|\n+---DataStorageException\n```\n4. Define the specific exception types: Once we have defined the hierarchy, we need to define the specific exception types that will be used in each failure mode. For example, we might define a \"InvalidInputException\" class that has a message like \"Invalid input provided\" and a \"NetworkConnectionException\" class that has a message like \"Network connection failed.\"\n5. Use the exception classes: Finally, we need to use the exception classes in our code to handle errors appropriately. When an error occurs, we should create an instance of the appropriate exception class and throw it. For example, if we get invalid input, we might throw an \"InvalidInputException\" like this:\n```\nthrow new InvalidInputException(\"Invalid input provided\");\n```\nBy following these steps, we can create a structured error hierarchy with specific exception types for each failure mode. This will make our code more robust, easier to understand, and easier to maintain.\n\nI hope this helps!

Since we are in a coding task, we can use nltk if it's available? \n     But note: the environment might not have nltk. Alternatively, we can use a simple implementation of BLEU? That might be complex.\n\n However, the problem says \"automated evaluation\", so we are free to choose. Let's stick to simpler metrics if we don't have external libraries.\n\n But note: the task does not specify the language of the answers. We assume English.\n\n Since we are in a coding task, we can do:\n\n Option 1: Without external libraries, we can do:\n   - Exact match\n   - Levenshtein distance (if we have the library, but without it we can implement? But that's complex and slow for long strings)\n   - Cosine similarity on word vectors\n<|im_end|>", "task_id": "task_1", "agent": "coder", "status": "success"}

To plan a strategy to improve test coverage to 90% with specific module targets, we'll need to follow a structured approach. Here's a step-by-step guide to help us achieve this goal:\n\n1. Identify the current test coverage:\nFirst, we need to determine the current test coverage of our module. We can use a tool like CodeCoverage or Istanbul to measure the coverage and identify areas that need improvement.\n2. Set module-specific targets:\nNext, we'll need to identify the specific modules we want to focus on and set target coverage levels for each module. For example, we might want to aim for 90% coverage on our core functionality modules and 80% coverage on our supporting modules.\n3. Prioritize modules:\nBased on the current coverage and the targets we've set, we'll need to prioritize the modules that require the most attention. We can use a framework like MoSCoW (Must-Have, Should-Have, Could-Have, Won't-Have) to prioritize our modules and allocate resources accordingly.\n4. Create test cases:\nOnce we've identified the priority modules, we'll need to create test cases to increase coverage. We can use techniques like Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis, and State Transition Testing to create effective test cases.\n5. Implement test automation:\nTo improve test coverage efficiently, we can implement test automation using tools like Selenium, Appium, or Cypress. This will help us run tests faster and more accurately, allowing us to focus on other areas that require manual testing.\n6. Refactor code:\nAs we improve test coverage, we may need to refactor our code to make it more testable. We can use techniques like Extract Method, Inline Method, and Interface Segregation to make our code more modular and easier to test.\n7. Debug and optimize:\nOnce we've implemented test automation and refactored our code, we'll need to debug and optimize our tests. We can use tools like Debuggers, Profilers, and Code Analysis tools to identify issues and optimize our code for better performance.\n8.

Customer authentication\n  2. Customer profile management\n  3. Order processing\n  4. Payment processing\n  5. Sending notifications\n\n We'll refactor this into separate classes for each responsibility.\n\n Let's assume the original god object had methods like:\n  - authenticate(username, password)\n  - get_profile(customer_id)\n  - create_order(customer_id, items)\n  - process_payment(order_id, payment_info)\n  - send_welcome_email(customer)\n\n We'll create:\n  - AuthenticationService\n  - CustomerProfileService\n  - OrderService\n  - PaymentService\n  - EmailService\n\n Each class will have a single responsibility.\n\n We'll also create a main service that coordinates these services, but it shouldn't contain the core logic of each responsibility.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo refactor a \"god object\" into focused single-responsibility classes, we'll break down a monolithic class into specialized components.

Define the LoggingAdapter class that implements the same interface as the ITextGenerator (or at least the method we want to log).\n 2. We'll have a private field for the wrapped ITextGenerator.\n 3. We'll have a logger (like Serilog or NLog) that can write structured logs. We'll use a logger that supports structured logging (e.g., Serilog).\n 4. We will log:\n    - The input parameters (structured) at the start of the generation.\n    - The result and any metadata (like duration) at the end.\n    - Also, log any exceptions that occur.\n\n We'll assume the following method signature for ITextGenerator:\n    public interface ITextGenerator\n    {\n        string GenerateText(string input);\n    }\n\n However, the input might be more complex. Let's assume we have a class for input.\n\n Let me adjust to a more general case:\n\n    public interface ITextGenerator\n    {\n        string GenerateText(TextGenerationInput input);\n    }\n\n    public class TextGenerationInput\n    {\n        public string Prompt { get; set; }\n        // other properties as needed\n    }\n\n We'll log:\n    - Input details (e.g., Prompt, other properties) at the beginning.\n    - Start time, then when done, record the duration and result.\n    - Log any exception that occurs.\n\n We'll use a logger that we inject. We can use an ILogger from Microsoft.Extensions.Logging (which supports structured logging) or Serilog.\n\n For structured logging, we can use:\n\n    ILogger<LoggingAdapter> logger\n\n But note: the ILogger in Microsoft.Extensions.Logging is an interface that supports structured logging via message templates.\n\n Alternatively, if we are using Serilog, we can use ISerilogLogger or just ILogger from Microsoft.\n\n Since the task doesn't specify, I'll use Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.\n\n We'll design:\n\n    public class LoggingAdapter : ITextGenerator\n    {\n        private readonly ITextGenerator _textGenerator;\n        private readonly ILogger<LoggingAdapter> _logger;\n\n        public LoggingAdapter(ITextGenerator textGenerator, ILogger<LoggingAdapter> logger)\n        {\n<|im_end|>", "task_id": "task_1", "agent": "tester", "status": "success"}

Here's an example implementation of a `RetryExecutionUseCase` that wraps an executor with an exponential backoff strategy:\n```\nimport time\nimport random\n\nclass RetryExecutionUseCase:\n    def __init__(self, executor, max_attempts=3, delay_multiplier=2):\n        self.executor = executor\n        self.max_attempts = max_attempts\n        self.delay_multiplier = delay_multiplier\n\n    def execute(self, task):\n        attempt = 0\n        while attempt < self.max_attempts:\n            try:\n                return self.executor.execute(task)\n            except Exception as e:\n                attempt += 1\n                delay = random.random() * (2 ** attempt) * self.delay_multiplier\n                time.sleep(delay)\n                continue\n        raise e\n```\nThis class takes in an executor, a maximum number of attempts, and a delay multiplier. It implements a simple exponential backoff strategy, where the delay between attempts grows exponentially with the number of attempts. The `execute` method wraps the executor's `execute` method and retries the task up to the maximum number of attempts. If all attempts fail, it raises the last exception that occurred.\n\nYou can use this class like this:\n```\nexecutor = MyExecutor()\nretry_use_case = RetryExecutionUseCase(executor, max_attempts=5, delay_multiplier=3)\nresult = retry_use_case.execute(my_task)\n```\nThis will execute the `my_task` task up to 5 times, with an exponential backoff strategy that delays for a random amount of time between 0 and 30 seconds (3^2, 3^3, 3^4, 3^5) before retrying. If all attempts fail, it will raise the last exception that occurred.\n\nI hope this helps!

We also define a `TaskCoordinatorFactory` class that has the same dependencies, and a `createTaskCoordinator` method that creates a new `TaskCoordinator` instance with the given dependencies.\n\nThe `createTaskCoordinator` method is annotated with the `@inject` decorator, which tells Inversify that this method should be injected with the dependencies when the `TaskCoordinatorFactory` instance is created.\n\nTo use this factory method, you can create a `TaskCoordinatorFactory` instance and call the `createTaskCoordinator` method to get a new `TaskCoordinator` instance with all required dependencies injected:\n```\nconst taskRepository = new TaskRepository();\nconst workerPool = new WorkerPool();\nconst logger = new Logger();\n\nconst taskCoordinatorFactory = new TaskCoordinatorFactory(taskRepository, workerPool, logger);\nconst taskCoordinator = taskCoordinatorFactory.createTaskCoordinator();\n\ntaskCoordinator.coordinateTasks().catch((error) => {\n  logger.error(error);\n});\n<|im_end|>", "task_id": "task_1", "agent": "coder", "status": "success"}

IAgentPlanner: for planning-related methods.\n  2. IAgentExecutor: for execution-related methods.\n\n Then, we will refactor the existing IAgentCoordinator to either:\n   - Be split into two separate interfaces (if the current one is monolithic) and then have a coordinator that uses both.\n   - Or, if the current coordinator already has two distinct parts, then we can extract the two.\n\n However, note that the task says \"Refactor IAgentCoordinator\", so we are likely to change the interface.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Identify the methods in IAgentCoordinator that are related to planning.\n 2. Identify the methods that are related to execution.\n 3. Create two new interfaces: IAgentPlanner and IAgentExecutor.\n 4. Move the respective methods to the new interfaces.\n 5. If the existing IAgentCoordinator is still needed, we can either:\n      a.

Look for classes or modules that have multiple reasons to change. \n    - If a class is modified for more than one reason, it likely violates SRP.\n 2. Check if a class has more than one job. \n    - For example, if a class both manages data and also handles user interface, it might be violating SRP.\n 3. Look for methods that do more than one thing. \n    - If a method is doing multiple distinct operations, it might be better to split.\n\n Without the code, I can create a hypothetical example and then refactor it.\n\n Hypothetical Example:\n\n Suppose `task_coordinator.py` has a class `TaskCoordinator` that:\n   - Manages a list of tasks.\n   - Saves tasks to a file.\n   - Sends notifications when tasks are completed.\n   - Logs the actions.\n\n This class might have multiple responsibilities: task management, I/O (file operations), notification, and logging.\n\n Proposed Refactoring Strategy:\n\n 1. Identify distinct responsibilities:\n    - Task Management: adding, removing, updating tasks.\n    - Persistence: saving and loading tasks to/from a file.\n    - Notification: sending emails or messages when a task is done.\n    - Logging: logging actions to a file or console.\n\n 2. Create separate classes for each responsibility.\n\n 3.
