# Release v1.0.0 - Current Status

**Updated:** 2025-09-30  
**Quick Check:** `./scripts/check-release.sh`

---

## ‚úÖ Current Status

```
‚úì Local tag v1.0.0 exists
‚úì Remote tag pushed to GitHub  
‚úì GitHub Release created
‚è≥ PyPI publication pending
```

---

## üîç What We Know

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Tag pushed successfully** - v1.0.0 is on GitHub
2. **GitHub Release created** - Release page exists
3. **Workflow progressed** - At least reached the release creation step

### ‚è≥ In Progress / Pending
1. **PyPI publication** - Package not yet available
   - This could mean:
     - Workflow still running (most likely)
     - PyPI publication step failed
     - Workflow queued/delayed

---

## üéØ Next Steps

### Step 1: Check Workflow Status (IMPORTANT)

**Open in browser:**
```
https://github.com/hollis-source/unified-intelligence-cli/actions
```

Look for the workflow triggered by tag v1.0.0 and check:
- ‚úÖ Green checkmark = Success
- üü° Yellow circle = Running
- ‚ùå Red X = Failed

### Step 2: Check Workflow Logs

If the workflow shows ‚ùå Failed:
1. Click on the failed workflow
2. Click on the "publish-pypi" job
3. Check logs for errors (common issues below)

### Step 3: Verify PyPI Publication

After workflow shows ‚úÖ Success:
```bash
pip install unified-intelligence-cli==1.0.0
ui-cli --version
```

## üêõ Common PyPI Publication Issues

If the workflow failed at PyPI publication:

### Issue 1: Project Name Already Taken
**Error:** "Project name already exists"
**Solution:** Someone else registered the name. Need to:
- Choose a different name
- Or claim the existing project if it's yours

### Issue 2: Invalid API Token
**Error:** "Invalid or expired token"
**Solution:** 
```bash
# Regenerate token at https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/
# Then update secret:
python scripts/setup-secrets.py
```

### Issue 3: Package Validation Failed
**Error:** "Package validation failed"
**Solution:** Check twine validation locally:
```bash
source venv-automation/bin/activate
python -m build
twine check dist/*
```

### Issue 4: First Time Publishing
**Error:** "Project does not exist"
**Note:** First-time publications to PyPI sometimes require manual registration
**Solution:** May need to publish manually first time:
```bash
source venv-automation/bin/activate
python -m build
twine upload dist/*
```

## üîß Manual PyPI Publication (If Needed)

If automated publication failed, publish manually:

```bash
# 1. Activate virtual environment
source venv-automation/bin/activate

# 2. Clean and rebuild package
rm -rf dist/
python -m build

# 3. Check package
twine check dist/*

# 4. Upload to PyPI (requires PYPI_API_TOKEN)
export TWINE_USERNAME=__token__
export TWINE_PASSWORD=your_pypi_api_token_here
twine upload dist/*
```

## üìä Verification Checklist

Once everything is working:

- [ ] GitHub tag v1.0.0 exists
- [ ] GitHub Release page shows v1.0.0
- [ ] PyPI shows version 1.0.0
- [ ] `pip install unified-intelligence-cli==1.0.0` works
- [ ] `ui-cli --version` shows 1.0.0
- [ ] Docker Hub has image (if applicable)

---

## üéØ Action Required

**Right now, you need to:**

1. **Check GitHub Actions workflow** (most important!)
   ```
   https://github.com/hollis-source/unified-intelligence-cli/actions
   ```

2. **Look for the v1.0.0 workflow run**
   - Find the workflow triggered by "v1.0.0" tag
   - Check if it's running, succeeded, or failed

3. **If failed:**
   - Check the "publish-pypi" job logs
   - Report the error for troubleshooting

4. **If still running:**
   - Wait for completion (shouldn't take more than 10 minutes total)
   - Check again with: `./scripts/check-release.sh`

5. **If succeeded but PyPI still empty:**
   - This might be first-time registration issue
   - May need manual publication (instructions above)

---

## üìû Quick Commands

**Check status:**
```bash
./scripts/check-release.sh
```

**Monitor workflow (if gh CLI works):**
```bash
gh run list --workflow=release.yml
```

**Manual publication (if needed):**
```bash
source venv-automation/bin/activate
python -m build
twine upload dist/*
```

---

## üí° Most Likely Scenario

Based on the status:
- ‚úì GitHub Release was created
- ‚è≥ PyPI publication might have failed OR still queued

**Next action:** Check the GitHub Actions workflow page to see the exact status and any error messages.
